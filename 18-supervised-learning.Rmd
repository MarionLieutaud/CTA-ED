# Exercise 7: Sampling text information

## Introduction

The hands-on exercise for this week focuses on how to classify a sample of text. 


### Data

We will be classifying the same tweets as discussed in @barrie2023did.

```{r, echo = F, eval = T}
tweets_sample <- readRDS("data/tweets-ranked.rds")
```

You can do this locally on your computers with:

```{r, eval = F, echo = T}
tweets_sample  <- readRDS(gzcon(url("https://github.com/cjbarrie/CS-ED/blob/main/data/tweets-ranked.rds?raw=true")))

```
