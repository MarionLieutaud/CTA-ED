<p>The hands-on exercise for this week focuses on how to collect and/or sample text information.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access text information from online corpora</li>
<li>Query text information using different APIs</li>
<li>Scrape text information programmatically</li>
<li>Transcribe text information from audio</li>
<li>Extract text information from images</li>
</ul>

<p>There are large numbers of online corpora and replication datasets available to access freely online. We will first access such an example using the <code>dataverse</code> package in R, which allows us to download directly from replication data repositories stored at the <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/">Harvard Dataverse</a>.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb393"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>Let’s take an example dataset in which we might be interested: the UK parliamentary speech data from</p>
<p>We first need to set an en environment variable as so.</p>

<p>We can then search out the files that we want by specifying the DOI of the publication data in question. We can find this as a series of numbers and letters that come after “<a href="https://doi.org/" class="uri">https://doi.org/</a>” as shown below.</p>

<p>We choose to get the UK data from these files, which is listed under “UK_data.csv.” We can then download this directly in the following way (this will take some time as the file size is &gt;1GB).</p>

<p>Of course, we could also download these data manually, by clicking the buttons at the relevant <a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/">Harvard Dataverse</a>—but it is sometimes useful to build in every step of your data collection to your code documentation, making the analysis entirely programatically reproducible from start to finish.</p>
<p>Note as well that we don’t have to search out specific datasets that we already know about. We can also use the <code>dataverse</code> package to search datasets or dataverses. We can do this very simply in the following way.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">23.3</span> Using APIs<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#using-apis"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>In order to use the YouTube API, we’ll first need to get our authorization token. These can be obtained by anybody, with or without an academic profile (i.e., unlike <code>academictwitteR</code>) in previous worksheets.</p>
<p>In order to get you authorization credentials, you can follow this <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started">guide</a>. You will need to have an account on the Google Cloud console in order to do this. The main three steps are to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>create a “Project” on the Google Cloud console;</li>
<li>to associate the YouTube API with this Project;</li>
<li>to enable the API keys for the API</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have created a Project (here: called “tuberalt1” in my case) you will see a landing screen like this.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="data/sampling/Screenshot%202022-10-31%20at%2014.59.25.jpg"></div>
<p>We can then get our credentials by navigating to the menu on the left hand side and selecting credentials:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="data/sampling/Screenshot%202022-10-31%20at%2014.59.41.jpg"></div>
<p>Now we click on the name of our project (“tuberalt1”) and we will be taken to a page containing two pieces of information: our “client ID” and “client secret”.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="data/sampling/Screenshot%202023-03-15%20at%2015.55.31.png"></div>
<p>The client ID is referred to below as our “app ID” in the <code>tuber</code> packaage and the client secret is our “app secret” mentioned in the <code>tuber</code> package.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="data/sampling/Screenshot%202023-03-15%20at%2015.55.45.png"></div>
<p>Once we have our credentials, we can log them in our R environment with the <code>yt_oauth</code> function in the <code>tuber</code> package. This function takes two arguments: an “app ID” and an “app secret”. Both of these will be provided to you once you have associated the YouTube API with your Google Cloud console project.</p>

<p>In the paper by <span class="citation">Haroon et al. (<a href="references-2.html#ref-haroon2022">2022</a>)</span>, the authors analyze the recommended videos for a particular used based on their watch history and on a seed video. In the below, we won’t replicate the first step but we will look at the recommended videos that appear based on a seed video.</p>
<p>In this case, our seed video is a video by Jordan Peterson predicting the death of mainstream media. This is fairly “alternative” content and is actively taking a stance against mainstream media. So does this mean YouTube will learn to recommend us <em>away</em> from mainstream content?</p>

<p>In the above, we first take the unique identifying code string for the video. You can find this in the url for the video as shown below.</p>

<p>We can then collect the videos recommended on the basis of having this video as the seed video. We store these as the data.frame object <code>rel_vids</code>.</p>
<p>And we can have a look at the recommended videos on the basis of this seed video below.</p>

Peterson is a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto, a clinical psychologist and the author of the multi-million copy bestseller 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos, #1 for nonfiction in 2018 in the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, the Netherlands, Brazil and Norway, and slated for translation into 50 languages.\\n\\nJordan Peterson's a clinical psychologist and professor of psychology at the University of Toronto. He authored Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief in 1999. He worked as an associate professor in the psychology department at Harvard University.\\n\\nAccording to Peterson, he learned to read at the age of 3, and attended the United Church of Canada with his family. After graduating from Fairview High School in 1979, Peterson entered the Grande Prairie Regional College to study political science. He later transferred to the University of Alberta, where he completed his B.A. in 1982. In 1985, he moved to Montreal to attend McGill University. He earned his Ph.D. in clinical psychology under the supervision of Robert O. Pihl and Maurice Dongier in 1991. Peterson lived in Massachusetts, while teaching and conducting research at Harvard University as an assistant and an associate professor in the psychology department. During his time at Harvard, he studied aggression arising from drug and alcohol abuse, and supervised a number of unconventional thesis proposals. In 2004, a 13-part TV series based on his book Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief aired on TVOntario. He has also appeared on TVO on shows such as Big Ideas. Peterson was nominated for the position of Rector of the University of Glasgow in March 2017. \\n\\n►Video footage:  All video footage is licensed under CC-BY 3.0 or licensed from stock footage websites. \\n\\n►Music licensed through https://artlist.io/\\n\\nHowever, if any content owners would like their images removed, please contact us by email at chirea.catalin95@gmail.com\\n\\nSpeaker: \\n\\n\\nJordan Peterson\\n\\n// LINKS //\\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com\\nEvents: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events\\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog\\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast\\n\\n// SOCIAL //\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson\\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","7":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U80_D4ts_aE/default.jpg","8":"120","9":"90","10":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U80_D4ts_aE/mqdefault.jpg","11":"320","12":"180","13":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U80_D4ts_aE/hqdefault.jpg","14":"480","15":"360","16":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U80_D4ts_aE/sddefault.jpg","17":"640","18":"480","19":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/U80_D4ts_aE/maxresdefault.jpg","20":"1280","21":"720","22":"Grow Successful","23":"none","24":"2021-11-29T12:51:58Z"},{"1":"1Gp7xNnW5n8","2":"YYCnOnZ7zyI","3":"2021-01-07T15:40:22Z","4":"UCKsP3v2JeT2hWI_HzkxWiMA","5":"\"This KEEPS 99% of People Single!\" - FIX THIS TO FIND LOVE| Joe Dispenza","6":"Download podcast episodes a week early! http://www.lewishowes.com/pod\\nVisit Dr. Joe Dispenza's site here - https://drjoedispenza.com/\\n\\nDr. Joe Dispenza is an international speaker, researcher, author, and educator who is passionate about the findings from the fields of neuroscience, epigenetics, and quantum physics to explore the science behind spontaneous remissions. He uses that knowledge to help people heal themselves of illness, chronic conditions, and even terminal diseases so they can enjoy a more fulfilled and happy life as well as evolve their consciousness.\\n\\nDr. Joe is the New York Times bestselling author of You Are the Placebo: Making Your Mind Matter, which explores our ability to heal without drugs or surgery, but rather by thought alone. His most recent book, Becoming Supernatural, talks about how we can intentionally change our brain chemistry to initiate profoundly mystical, transcendental experiences and develop a more healthy body, mind, and spiritual life.\\n\\nDr. Joe didn’t always work in the field of neuroscience. He started out as a chiropractor, earning his doctor of chiropractic degree from Life University in Atlanta, GA. He had a successful chiropractic practice, but one day he had a dangerous accident. In 1986, while cycling in a triathlon, Dr. Joe was hit by a truck. He broke six vertebrae in his spine, and his doctors told him he would never walk again.\\n\\nDr. Joe asked four different surgeons what he should do, and all four of them prescribed a complicated surgery. The surgery would relieve some of his pain but nearly guarantee he would never walk again. But that wasn’t good enough. He refused to have the surgery and instead began to imagine himself totally healed. He visualized each vertebrae healing and reconstructed his spine in his mind. In just ten and a half weeks, Dr. Joe was back on his feet, and in twelve weeks, he was training again and back at work at his chiropractic clinic. He fully healed himself with just his mind.\\n\\nI’ve had Dr. Joe a couple of times on the podcast now (Episode 826 and Episode 679), and in the past, we’ve talked about unlocking the power of the mind and breaking the addiction of negative thoughts. But in today’s episode, I wanted to change it up and ask Dr. Joe about relationships. Our conversation blew me away so much that I had to split this interview up into two parts, so stay tuned for the second part on Wednesday!\\n\\nBut for now, join me on Episode 1,054 to learn about how to transform your mind for lasting love and magnetic relationships with the incredible Dr. Joe Dispenza!","7":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YYCnOnZ7zyI/default.jpg","8":"120","9":"90","10":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YYCnOnZ7zyI/mqdefault.jpg","11":"320","12":"180","13":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YYCnOnZ7zyI/hqdefault.jpg","14":"480","15":"360","16":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YYCnOnZ7zyI/sddefault.jpg","17":"640","18":"480","19":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/YYCnOnZ7zyI/maxresdefault.jpg","20":"1280","21":"720","22":"Lewis Howes","23":"none","24":"2021-01-07T15:40:22Z"},{"1":"1Gp7xNnW5n8","2":"dB7d89-YHjM","3":"2020-03-02T13:52:14Z","4":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","5":"What Happened At The Beginning Of Time? - with Dan Hooper","6":"We’re learning more and more about the recent history of our universe, but how much do we really know about its very first few seconds?\\nDan’s book \"At The Edge Of Time\" is available now - https://geni.us/noTSA\\n\\nWatch the Q&A: https://youtu.be/Vjkj0m9YgcA\\n\\nEver since Edwin Hubble observed that the universe was expanding in 1929, cosmologists have had their work cut out for them trying to solve the seemingly impossible questions arising from the time immediately after the Big Bang.\\n\\nIn this talk Dan Hooper explores the perplexing problems surrounding the secrets of the early universe, and the far-reaching implications some of the answers might have for the understanding of the universe we think we have today.\\n\\nDan Hooper is Senior Scientist and the Head of the Theoretical Astrophysics Group at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory.

Joyce | #287","6":"Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\\n\\nThe Trans movement surges across western civilization, necessitating the ego-centric fantasies of gender-dysphoric youths over what once was known commonly as indisputable reality. Helen Joyce and Dr Jordan B Peterson discuss the depths of this truly cultural battle, the dangers of a quickly growing transhumanist ideology, and the unbridled narcissism lurking at the heart of the conflict.\\n\\nHelen Joyce is an Irish novelist and journalist, acting as the executive editor for events and business at the Economist in London. Before this, she trained as a mathematician, graduating from the Trinity College in Dublin, before attending Cambridge. She then acquired a PHD in geometric measure theory at the University College London.

Governments are being forced to press their citizens, straining already fragile economic and agricultural systems, in order to appease a globalist utopian vision. Bjørn Lomborg and Ralph Schoellhammer sit down with Dr Jordan B Peterson to discuss the faults in this plan, and the people who are suffering because of it.\\n\\nBjørn Lomborg is a Danish author, having written numerous books on climate change such as “False Alarm,” “The Skeptical Environmentalist,” and “How to Spend $75 Billion to Make the World a Better Place.” He is the president of the think tank Copenhagen Consensus Center that focuses on doing the most good, for the most people, with increasingly limited budgets. Previously, Lomborg was the director of the Danish government's Environmental Assessment Institute.\\n\\nRalph Schoellhammer is a scholar and journalist operating in Europe who has diligently covered overlooked stories such as the Dutch Farmers Protest.

The driver had his phone hooked up through the stereo and was pumping out an episode through the car speakers — loudly, as if looking to convert a captive audience.\\n\\n“Do you like Kyle Kulinski?”\\n\\nThe driver, Ahmed, was a recent immigrant and apparently a die-hard fan of Secular Talk, the political talk show that Kulinski broadcasts on YouTube. I told him, yes, in fact. I do like Kulinski, had come across his show several years ago, and, all things considered, he seemed pretty good.\\n\\n“He understands what we’re up against,” Ahmed said. “Like Bernie.”\\n\\nBut I was surprised to hear Kulinski’s name mentioned in the same breath as Bernie Sanders, particularly with such adoration. Because what I did remember about Kulinski’s show struck me as mostly capital-P “progressive” takes on the news — the left wing of the Netroots crowd more than the democratic socialism Sanders has popularized.\\n\\nIt’s an impression that wasn’t entirely incorrect.\\n\\n“I have no time for philosophical, airy bullshit,” Kulinski tells me from his home in Westchester, New York. “I don’t want to hear about Lenin. I don’t want to hear about Marx. I just want a super plainspoken, straightforward agenda with a straightforward way of selling it.”\\n\\nWith over 800,000 subscribers and nearly 670 million total views on YouTube, selling a progressive agenda is clearly something Kulinski knows how to do — even Democracy Now, the long-standing flagship of progressive media, cannot match his reach on the platform. Chapo Trap House can certainly boast a wildly devoted fan base (and a not insignificant degree of media influence), but their audience is roughly half the size of Kulinski’s.\\n\\nWhile Secular Talk might be more likely to be looped in with the progressive networks around Air America and Pacifica alums like Sam Seder than the more resolutely socialist world, Kulinski’s fiery rhetoric, razor-sharp class instincts, and knack for withering takedowns sets him apart from his peers. Judging by his rhetoric alone, he’s closer to a Eugene Debs than a Chris Hayes.\\n\\nBut unlike Hayes, Amy Goodman, or his friend Cenk Uygur of The Young Turks — who began airing Secular Talk on his web network seven years ago — the thirty-two-year-old Kulinski is virtually invisible in the mainstream media. Despite his enormous fan base, his show has never once been mentioned in the obligatory trend pieces on “the Millennial Left” pumped out by the prestige media. Nor has Kulinski’s name ever popped up at all in the New York Times, Vox, the New Yorker, New York Magazine, or the Washington Post, despite his leading role in cofounding Justice Democrats, the organization widely credited with sweeping Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the rest of “the Squad” to power.\\n\\nJust last week, his Wikipedia page was deleted. The reason? “There is very simply no [reliable source] coverage of this person,” according to one moderator. In new media, he’s king — the Sean Hannity of the Berniecrat left. In old media, he’s nobody.\\n\\nI suspect there are a few reasons for that. There is nothing “cool” about Kulinski’s show. (As a friend put it, “‘Welcome to Secular Talk’ sounds like something you’d hear on Egyptian radio.”) His no-nonsense social-democratic politics won’t get him much cred with the Full Communism crowd. He records his show not in Brooklyn or Los Angeles, but in a studio he built himself in his modest Westchester home. His hair is too groomed and his taste in clothes too preppy to qualify as “Dirtbag Left.” Nor has he ever attended an n+1 release party. “Not only have I not attended one,” he says, “I have no idea what that means.”\\n\\nAnd yet he’s astonishingly plugged-in for a young man in the suburbs. Wondering how Sanders ended up on the Joe Rogan Experience? Kulinski, a frequent guest on Rogan’s wildly popular show, introduced them. “You make the most sense to me,” Rogan told Kulinski on a recent episode. “You’re a normal person.”\\n\\nMuch like Sanders himself, Kulinski’s show has a massive audience that just doesn’t compute with our media’s understanding of “what the kids want” or even “what the left-wing kids want.”\\n\\nIt’s probably for the best — the very woke and very WASP-ish decorum haunting much of the media world is nowhere to be found in Secular Talk. “Corporate Democrats over-focus on identity as a trick to divert you from the issues that unite us all — class issues,” he said on a recent episode. “That Raytheon decided they don’t hate gays or trans people — frankly, I don’t really give a shit what their take on that is...\"\\n\\nRead More Here!:\\nhttps://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/kyle-kulinski-bernie-bros-secular-talk-joe-rogan-youtube\\n\\n#KyleKulinski #SecularTalk","7":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F0EFlYV4b4M/default.jpg","8":"120","9":"90","10":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F0EFlYV4b4M/mqdefault.jpg","11":"320","12":"180","13":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F0EFlYV4b4M/hqdefault.jpg","14":"480","15":"360","16":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F0EFlYV4b4M/sddefault.jpg","17":"640","18":"480","19":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/F0EFlYV4b4M/maxresdefault.jpg","20":"1280","21":"720","22":"Secular Talk","23":"none","24":"2022-02-09T20:02:56Z"},{"1":"1Gp7xNnW5n8","2":"BtkwF5qA6uE","3":"2018-08-30T19:07:03Z","4":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","5":"AB Harris/Weinstein/Peterson Discussion: Vancouver","6":"Harris/Weinstein/Peterson: Discussion 02: Vancouver\\n\\nThis is the second video of the four-part debate that Sam Harris and I undertook in June 2018. \\n\\nSam and I met twice in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, with Bret Weinstein moderating, for a third time in Dublin, Ireland, and for a fourth and final time in London, England. Douglas Murray joined the debate with us for the latter two occasions. \\n\\nVideo 1: Vancouver: https://bit.ly/2OlRZUa\\nVideo 2: Vancouver: https://bit.ly/2CUQT0g\\nVideo 3: https://bit.ly/2CUa0HG\\nVideo 4: https://bit.ly/2On6Y0a\\n\\nSam is a well-known Enlightenment rationalist, and a prominent atheist – one of the “four horsemen,” along with Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens (now unfortunately deceased) and Daniel Dennett. He believes (1) that our ethical systems should or even must be grounded in something other than arbitrary revelation or opinion; (2) that the world of facts can and should provide that grounding; and (3) that the grounding of values in fact can occur in the absence of much perceptual or cognitive intermediation. \\nI agree with him with regard to point (1) but not point (2) and (3). I won’t present any of my argument here, however, because Sam isn’t here to respond, as he is in the videos. \\n\\nI have also written three blog posts on the Harris/Peterson discussions, here:\\n\\n1. https://jordanbpeterson.com/philosophy/facts-and-values-science-and-religion-notes-on-the-sam-harris-discussions-part-i/\\n\\n2. https://jordanbpeterson.com/philosophy/facts-from-values-not-without-an-intermediary-notes-on-the-sam-harris-discussions-part-ii/\\n\\n3. TBA\\n\\nA note on the release of the videos, and their delay: Any event of this scale occurs because of the collaboration of many people, including, in this case. Travis Pangburn and his staff at Pangburn Philosophy, who organized and promoted the four-part debate series, and who incurred substantial financial and reputational risk in doing so (as nothing like this has been attempted before at this scale). None of us were sure at the outset whether Sam and I would manage a useful discussion, let alone four of them, or whether there would be a positive public response. In consequence, we didn’t spend much time before the debate series thinking about release (or formatting/editing) of video or audio recording. Since the events went well, however – appearing both productive and well-received publicly – we decided to move ahead with the production and release of the recordings. The team at Pangburn Philosophy completed the editing, in consequence. Sam and I agreed to allow the initial release behind Travis’s Patreon paywall, for a two-week period, after which we would post the videos for full public access on our respective video platforms, and release the audio in podcast form. The team at Pangburn Philosophy plans to use some substantial portion of what was raised through Patreon subscription for multi-language translation of their previously produced and future content (including these four debates). \\n\\n--- SUPPORT THIS CHANNEL ---\\n\\nDirect Support: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/donate\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson\\n\\n--- BOOKS ---\\n\\n12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos: https://jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/\\nMaps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief: https://jordanbpeterson.com/maps-of-meaning/\\n\\n--- LINKS ---\\n\\nWebsite: https://jordanbpeterson.com/\\n12 Rules for Life Tour: https://jordanbpeterson.com/events/\\nBlog: https://jordanbpeterson.com/blog/\\nPodcast: https://jordanbpeterson.com/podcast/\\nReading List: https://jordanbpeterson.com/great-books/\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/jordanbpeterson\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/jordan.b.peterson/\\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/drjordanpeterson\\n\\n--- PRODUCTS ---\\n\\nPersonality Course: https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/personality\\nSelf Authoring Suite: https://selfauthoring.com/\\nUnderstand Myself personality test: https://understandmyself.com/\\nMerchandise: https://teespring.com/stores/jordanbpeterson","7":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BtkwF5qA6uE/default.jpg","8":"120","9":"90","10":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BtkwF5qA6uE/mqdefault.jpg","11":"320","12":"180","13":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BtkwF5qA6uE/hqdefault.jpg","14":"480","15":"360","16":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BtkwF5qA6uE/sddefault.jpg","17":"640","18":"480","19":"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/BtkwF5qA6uE/maxresdefault.jpg","20":"1280","21":"720","22":"Jordan B Peterson","23":"none","24":"2018-08-30T19:07:03Z"},{"1":"1Gp7xNnW5n8","2":"PY4sShDt9to","3":"2017-09-03T15:20:56Z","4":"UCL_f53ZEJxp8TtlOkHwMV9Q","5":"The Neuroscience of Intelligence: Dr. Richard Haier","6":"There is almost nothing more important to understand about people than intelligence. It can be measured more accurately than anything else in the social sciences. It differs tremendously and importantly between individuals. It is the single most important determinant of life success. It's very existence, however, remains subject to substantive debate, most of it highly politicized. \\n\\nDr. Richard Haier has recently written a major book on the topic, The Neuroscience of Intelligence (http://amzn.to/2em55A9), summarized in the following manner: \"This book introduces new and provocative neuroscience research that advances our understanding of intelligence and the brain. Compelling evidence shows that genetics plays a more important role than environment as intelligence develops from childhood, and that intelligence test scores correspond strongly to specific features of the brain assessed with neuroimaging. In understandable language, Richard J. Haier explains cutting-edge techniques based on genetics, DNA, and imaging of brain connectivity and function.

Unfortunately, for many reasons, this presumption is simply incorrect. In fact, the reverse is true, insofar as social engineering is concerned: the personality and other differences between men and women MAXIMIZES instead of minimizing in exactly those societies that have moved closest to the egalitarian ideal (the Scandinavian countries). This is because those countries have eradicated most of the environmentally-produced variation in these traits, leaving only those that are genetic to manifest themselves.

At the beginning of last December, the end of the dictatorial regimes began with successive protests against high prices in Algeria and Jordan. Then the Tunisian revolution demanded the fall of the regime. Algeria caught the ball of flames, and protests ignited again after having calmed for a time. Then after the Tunisian president was expelled, the revolution reached Egypt. And when Egyptians deposed Mubarak, the sparks proceeded to Algeria, Jordan, Yemen, Bahrain, and then Libya.\n \nThe issue is not one of infection; rather, the subjugated peoples discovered the potential of their own free will. The revolution in one country inspired the populations in other countries, for people imprison themselves in waiting, hoping and yearning, until their spirits emerge carrying the roar of anger that shakes thrones. Every population transfers the experience of other revolutions, borrowing their slogans—’the people want the fall of the regime,’ and ‘peaceful, peaceful’—and their tactics, like the Friday of Anger in Jordan and sit-ins held in major squares located in middle of the capital, such as Egypt’s Tahrir Square. Tunisian revolutionaries contacted Egyptians, providing them with some tactics to beat the regime’s machine, like spraying the windshields of armored cars with colors to paralyze and get the better of them.\n \nBeyond inspiration and transmitting experience, there is also solidarity, for the Tunisian revolution’s victory celebrations spread to Jordan and Egypt. And most of the Arab peoples participated in Egypt’s joy. There were many moving scenes, like the singing of the national anthem and the distribution of sweets and drinks in Jordan and Gaza in celebration of Mubarak’s deposal.\n \nHowever, the regimes that consolidate their interests over and against the people’s also rely on one another and exchange their experiences with oppression and harassment. And now confrontations are raging in Bahrain, Yemen, and Libya as mummified regimes committing increased acts of violence and brutal murder against the protesters. Just as Egypt’s extinct regime did, they use thugs with soft weaponry to transform the scene into bloody chaos. Meanwhile, Israel threatens chaos at the regional level in support of its spies, the Arab rulers, since the one who benefits most from the bowing down of the Arab peoples and their backwardness is none other than Israel.\n \n\nThe solidarity and support of the Arab revolutions for each other is the destiny of the Arab region and the only way to protect the interests and wealth of its peoples.  With the extinct regime issuing threats—as if from another world—that Omar Suleiman, Mubarak, or Ria and Sikina will return, the duty to protect our revolution has doubled. Our resistance won’t simply bring about complete, permanent victory for our own revolution; it will also support the revolutions of other populations who support us in turn. This is our duty and our destiny. For the populations who were long patient, the path of regression to what came before was no longer available.

<p>Well this looks pretty terrifying now…</p>
<p>We need a way of quickly identifying where the relevant text is so that we can specify this when we are scraping. The most widely-used tool to achieve this is the “Selector Gadget” Chrome Extension. You can add this to your browser for free <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb?hl=en">here</a>.</p>
<p>The tool works by allowing the user to point and click on elements of a webpage (or “CSS selectors”). Unlike alternatives, such as “Inspect Element” browser tools, we are easily able to see how the webpage item is contained within CSS selectors (rather than HTML tags alone), which is easier to parse.</p>
<p>We can do this with our Tahrir documents as below:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="data/sampling/gifcap4.gif" style="width:100.0%"></div>
<p>So now we know that the main text of the translated document is contained between “p” HTML tags. To identify the text between these HTML tags we can run:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb413"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

##  [6] "A member of the Algerian opposition warned the Arab rulers that the Tunisian revolution would initiate a revolutionary tsunami phenomenon that would sweep away their thrones. At the beginning of last December, the end of the dictatorial regimes began with successive protests against high prices in Algeria and Jordan. Then the Tunisian revolution demanded the fall of the regime. Algeria caught the ball of flames, and protests ignited again after having calmed for a time. Then after the Tunisian president was expelled, the revolution reached Egypt. And when Egyptians deposed Mubarak, the sparks proceeded to Algeria, Jordan, Yemen, Bahrain, and then Libya."

##  [8] "The issue is not one of infection; rather, the subjugated peoples discovered the potential of their own free will. The revolution in one country inspired the populations in other countries, for people imprison themselves in waiting, hoping and yearning, until their spirits emerge carrying the roar of anger that shakes thrones. Every population transfers the experience of other revolutions, borrowing their slogans—’the people want the fall of the regime,’ and ‘peaceful, peaceful’—and their tactics, like the Friday of Anger in Jordan and sit-ins held in major squares located in middle of the capital, such as Egypt’s Tahrir Square. Tunisian revolutionaries contacted Egyptians, providing them with some tactics to beat the regime’s machine, like spraying the windshields of armored cars with colors to paralyze and get the better of them."

<p>, which looks quite a lot more manageable…!</p>
<p>What is happening here? Essentially, the <code><a href="https://rvest.tidyverse.org/reference/html_element.html">html_elements()</a></code> function is scanning the page and collecting all HTML elements contained between <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags, which we collect using the “p” CSS selector. We are then just grabbing the text contained in this part of the page with the <code><a href="https://rvest.tidyverse.org/reference/html_text.html">html_text()</a></code> function.</p>
<p>So this gives us one way of capturing the text, but what about if we wanted to get other elements of the document, for example the date or the tags attributed to each document? Well we can do the same thing here too. Let’s take the example of getting the date:</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="data/sampling/gifcap5.gif" style="width:100.0%"></div>
<p>We see here that the date is identified by the “.calendar” CSS selector and so we enter this into the same <code><a href="https://rvest.tidyverse.org/reference/html_element.html">html_elements()</a></code> function as before:</p>

<p>Of course, this is all well and good, but we also need a way of doing this at scale—we can’t just keep repeating the same process for every page we find as this wouldn’t be much quicker than just copy pasting. So how can we do this? Well we need first to understand the URL structure of the website in question.</p>
<p>When we scroll down the page we see listed a number of documents. Each of these directs to an individual pamphlet distributed at protests during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.</p>
<p>Click on one of these and see how the URL changes.</p>
<p>We see that if our starting URL was:</p>
<pre><code>https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130135111/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/</code></pre>
<p>Then if we click on March 2011, the first month for which we have documents, we see that the url becomes:</p>
<pre><code>https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/</code></pre>
<p>, for August 2011 it becomes:</p>
<pre><code>https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130142155/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/08/</code></pre>
<p>, and for January 2012 it becomes:</p>
<pre><code>https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130142014/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2012/01/</code></pre>
<p>We notice that for each month, the URL changes with the addition of month and year between back slashes at the end or the URL. In the next section, we will go through how to efficiently create a set of URLs to loop through and retrieve the information contained in each individual webpage.</p>
<p>We are going to want to retrieve the text of documents archived for each month. As such, our first task is to store each of these webpages as a series of strings. We could do this manually by, for example, pasting year and month strings to the end of each URL for each month from March, 2011 to January, 2012:</p>

<p>What’s going on here? Well, we are first specifying the starting URL as above. We are then iterating through the numbers 3 to 13. And we are telling R to take the new URL and then, depending on the number in the loop we are on, to take the base starting url— <a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/" class="uri">https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/</a> — and to paste on the end of it the string “2011/0”, then the number of the loop we are on, and then “/”. So, for the first “i” in the loop—the number 3—then we are effectively calling the equivalent of:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb423"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">i</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fl">3</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span class="va">url</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="st">"https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/"</span></span>
<span></span>
<span><span class="va">newurl</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/paste.html">paste0</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">url</span>,<span class="st">"2011/0"</span>,<span class="va">i</span>,<span class="st">"/"</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>Which gives:</p>
<pre><code>## [1] "https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/"</code></pre>
<p>In the above, the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/ifelse.html">ifelse()</a></code> commands are simply telling R: if i (the number of the loop we are on) is less than 10 then <code>paste0(url,"2011/0",i,"/")</code>; i.e., if i is less than 10 then paste “2011/0”, then “i” and then “/”. So for the number 3 this becomes:</p>
<p><code>"https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/"</code></p>
<p>, and for the number 4 this becomes</p>
<p><code>"https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/04/"</code></p>
<p>If, however, <code>i&gt;=10 &amp; i&lt;=12</code> (i is greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 12) then we are calling <code>paste0(url,"2011/",i,"/")</code> because here we do not need the first “0” in the months.</p>
<p>Finally, if (else) i is greater than 12 then we are calling <code>paste0(url,"2012/01/")</code>. For this last call, notice, we do not have to specify whether i is greater than or equal to 12 because we are wrapping everything in <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/ifelse.html">ifelse()</a></code> commands. With <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/ifelse.html">ifelse()</a></code> calls like this, we are telling R if x “meets condition” then do y, otherwise do z. When we are wrapping multiple <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/ifelse.html">ifelse()</a></code> calls within each other, we are effectively telling R if x “meets condition” then do y, or if x “meets other condition” then do z, otherwise do a. So here, the “otherwise do a” part of the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/base/ifelse.html">ifelse()</a></code> calls is saying: if i is not less than 10, and is not between 10 and 12, then paste “2012/01/” to the end of the URL.</p>
<p>Got it? I didn’t even get it on first reading… and I wrote it. The best way to understand what is going on is to run this code yourself and look at what each part is doing.</p>
<p>So now we have our list of URLs for each month. What next?</p>
<p>Well if we go onto the page of a particular month, let’s say March, we will see that the page has multiple paginated tabs at the bottom. Let’s see what happens to the URL when we click on one of these:</p>
<p>We see that if our starting point URL for March, as above, was:</p>
<pre><code>https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/</code></pre>
<p>When we click through to page 2 it becomes:</p>
<pre><code>https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130163651/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/page/2/</code></pre>
<p>And for page 3 it becomes:</p>
<pre><code>https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130163651/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/page/3/</code></pre>
<p>We can see pretty clearly that as we navigate through each page, there appears appended to the URL the string “page/2/” and “page/3/”. So this shouldn’t be too tricky to add to our list of URLs. But we want to avoid having to manually click through the archive for each month to figure out how many pagination tabs are at the bottom of each page.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we don’t have to. Using the “Selector Gadget” tool again we can automate this process by grabbing the highest number that appears in the pagination bar for each month’s pages. The code below achieves this:</p>

<span><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>What’s going on here? Well, in the first two lines, we are simply creating an empty character string that we’re going to populate in the subsequent loop. Remember that we have a set of eleven starting URLs for each of months archived on this webpage.</p>
<p>So in the code beginning <code>for (i in seq_along(files)</code> we saying, similar to above, for the beginning url to the end url, do the following in a loop: first, read in the url with <code>url &lt;- urls[i]</code> then read the html it contains with <code>html &lt;- read_html(url)</code>.</p>
<p>After this line, we are getting the pages as a character vector of page numbers by calling the <code><a href="https://rvest.tidyverse.org/reference/html_element.html">html_elements()</a></code> function on the “.page” tag. this gives a series of pages stored as e.g. “1” “2” “3”.</p>
<p>In order to be able to see how many there are, we need to extract the highest number that appears in this string. To do this, we first need to reformat it as an “integer” object rather than a “character” object so that R can recognize that these are numbers. So we call <code>pageints &lt;- as.integer(pages)</code>. Then we get the maximum by simply calling: <code>npages &lt;- max(pageints, na.rm = T)</code>.</p>
<p>In the next part of the loop, we are taking the new information we have stored as “npages,” i.e., the number of pagination tabs for each month, and telling R: for each of these pages, define a new url by adding “page/” then the number of the pagination tab “j”, and then “/”. After we’ve bound all of these together, we get a list of URLs that look like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb429"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="fu"><a href="https://rdrr.io/r/utils/head.html">head</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="va">urlpages_all</span><span class="op">)</span></span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## [1] "https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/"       
## [2] "https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/page/2/"
## [3] "https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/page/3/"

## [6] "https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/page/6/"</code></pre>
<p>So what next?</p>
<p>The next step is to get the URLs for each of the documents contained in the archive for each month. How do we do this? Well, we can once again use the “Selector Gadget” tool to work this out. For the main landing pages of each month, we see listed, as below, each document in a list. For each of these documents, we see that the title, which links to the revolutionary leaflet in question, has two CSS selectors: “h2” and “.post”.</p>
<div class="inline-figure"><img src="data/sampling/gifcap6.gif" style="width:100.0%"></div>
<p>We can again pass these tags through <code><a href="https://rvest.tidyverse.org/reference/html_element.html">html_elements()</a></code> to grab what’s contained inside. We can then grab what’s contained inside these by extracting the “children” of these classes. In essence, this just means a lower level tag: tags can have tags within tags and these flow downwards like a family tree (hence the name, I suppose).</p>
<p>So one of the “children” of this HTML tag is the link contained inside, which we can get with calling <code><a href="https://rvest.tidyverse.org/reference/html_children.html">html_children()</a></code> followed by specifying that we want the specific attribute of the web link it encloses with <code>html_attr("href")</code>. The subsequent lines then just remove extraneous information.</p>
<p>The complete loop, then, to retrieve the URL of the page for every leaflet contained on this website is:</p>

</h2>
<p>There are some R packages that allow the user to connect to the Google Speech-to-Text engine (billing information required to access). You can find such a package <a href="https://github.com/ropensci/googleLanguageR">here</a> but it doesn’t seem to be readily maintained. There is a far wider range of options if you are open to using Python: see, e.g.: <a href="https://realpython.com/python-speech-recognition/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Here, we’re instead going to do the next best thing: capture text that has already been converted from speech. Here, we’re going to be collecting the automated English captioning from YouTube videos. For this, we will use the R package <code>youtubecaption</code>. Because this package connects to an already existing Python package under the hood, you’ll need to have a Conda environment installed. You can download Anaconda Individual Edition <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual">here</a>.</p>
<p>And to grab the text from a video is as simple as below.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb437"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<p>The last major technique that might be of interest for extracting text is Optical Character Recognition (OCR). This is a technique that reads in image files (e.g., .jpg or .png or .pdf) automatically extracts the text contained therein.</p>
<p>A very good package in R for extracting text from images is <code>daiR</code>, details of which can be found <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/daiR/index.html">here</a>. This connects again to the Google Cloud Engine (and thus requires billing info.) but it won’t charge you until you’ve spent your first free $300 of credit. This will take a while to spend so you have a good deal amount of tokens before you start incurring expenses.</p>
<p>You can consult <a href="https://dair.info/articles/setting_up_google_storage.html">here</a> for info. on setting up your Google Cloud service account.<br></p>
<p>Once you have done this you’ll be ready to connect to the Google Cloud Engine.</p>
