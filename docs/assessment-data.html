I am afraid I simply do not accept that the latter point is true This Parliament voted by a majority of nearly 300 to give the go ahead to a project that I personally believe is of key strategic importance to the United Kingdom over the coming decades I think that says it all

Yes Madam Deputy Speaker On 25 October I asked a parliamentary question on the very same subject when the risk assessment would be published and received a holding reply on 30 October Although I have heard no more from the Minister since on Monday morning I was amazed to read in The Daily Telegraph an extensive briefing which turns out to be extensively correct on precisely what would happen when the risk assessment was received I have still not received any response from the Minister to my perfectly legitimate question on the risk assessment That seems to be clear evidence that as my hon Friend the Member for Mid Worcestershire Mr Luff has correctly said the Government are more determined to spin the story in the press than to inform hon Members Is that not disgraceful

Does the hon Gentleman agree that although the Minister mentioned that the Government had allocated an extra 21 million that equates to 30 000 per constituency Does he also agree that that does not nearly cover the additional burden that has been placed on electoral registration officers over the past five years More particularly that money is not ring fenced so we do not even know whether it will be spent on that purpose

That is an extremely good point It is not just the International Association of Drilling Contractors that has welcomed the Government s approach to accepting the full recommendations of the Wood review but the overall trade body Oil and Gas UK Indeed the Scottish National party thinks that it is a good thing too Both the industry and the SNP have also welcomed some of the field allowances that the Government were forced to introduce particularly the ultra high temperature high pressure field allowance for mixed gas and oil fields That kind of measure is incredibly sensible but as my hon Friend says and as Oil and Gas UK points out there is huge disappointment that the Government are continuing with the bareboat charter measure They believe that it is ill conceived and should have been dropped in its entirety The backdrop to its introduction is a period in which operating costs have increased sharply Last year s cost increases of more than 15 led to an all time record high of almost 9 billion in costs I understand that new developments in the North sea are facing similar cost pressures so it is illogical to introduce this measure at this point especially as drilling rigs and accommodation vessels alone are included in the scope of the legislation We are looking at a part of the sector where the return on capital is only 8 or 9 and the cash break even on a drilling rig or an accommodation platform is typically 15 years These are large investments with investors taking substantial long term risks and we cannot understand why the Government want to put that at risk at this particular point

The issue in part is that we as Members of Parliament have a limit set of 1 per cent of our salary We have to be transparent about any donations we have or any moneys that come in relation to any entertainment in other words about 620 I fail to understand why other than purely for party political advantage to the Liberal Democrats the hon Gentleman wants to set a limit of 50 000 or as he now desires 10 000 Surely the issue here is transparency as we discussed earlier in the debate Provided everything is transparent surely that is the right way forward that will reassure the public that there is openness on those matters

I am grateful for my hon Friend s remarks I thought that we were a little more egalitarian in this party than to espouse the idea of having superiors but nevertheless I accept what he said It might be helpful if I briefly tell the House that Sir Hayden s review will examine the case for state funding including whether or not it should be enhanced in return for a cap on the size of donations He will consider too the transparency of funding of political parties so I hope that that covers some of the questions asked by my hon Friend I remind the House that Sam Younger said in The Times Political parties are important in a democracy They need funds in order to organise themselves develop policies and put themselves forward to the electorate It is a question of getting the balance right between state and private funding and that is part of the debate

On a point of order Mr Speaker This afternoon we are going to debate several groups of amendments and new clauses tabled to the Equality Bill They are massive groups and it looks as though we will not get through them in one day May I ask you Mr Speaker if there is anything that could be done by Members of this House even at this late stage if we were minded to seek more time to ensure that we are able properly to scrutinise the Bill

We have not done that As I was saying a moment ago we have increased the allocation of funding in respect of each pupil through the national funding formula Local authorities make the final decision on the allocation of funding between schools according to issues such as the proportion of children with special educational needs but I would be happy to sit down with the hon Lady to look specifically at the numbers that she has talked about in respect of that individual school

Does the Secretary of State accept that many on this side of the House believe that it is for this House and this Government to decide when a country such as China is dumping We should decide whether to impose tariffs Indeed many of us think that if we had been outside the EU months ago we would have imposed tariffs on Chinese dumping and would have solved the problem

I have already been generous in giving way and I am keen to make a little further progress Members on both sides of the House can be assured that we continue to make the point to the Bulgarian and Romanian Governments that more progress is necessary and indeed that both countries need to be aware of the scale of the challenge that they continue to face but we remain optimistic that they can meet the demanding requirements for membership by next year The fact that both countries have already demonstrated a capacity to realise impressive change in a relatively short period of time supports that contention The successful transformation of both countries from planned to market economies is perhaps the most visible and tangible evidence of progress Since the start of the process of European integration in 1999 the gross domestic product of both countries has grown by around 25 per cent Restructuring and the privatisation of inefficient and in many cases bankrupt communist state industries has taken place Their banking industries have also been privatised and the two states have rapidly integrated themselves with western European and world markets Indeed the EU has been the accession countries main trading partner for several years now Profound changes in the business environment have also taken place with the creation of food standards agencies competition regulators labour inspectorates and even insurance market supervisors That will I believe help UK firms doing business in and with those two countries The prospect of EU membership has given a major impetus to ongoing improvements in both states environmental policies and their health and safety standards

The hon Lady is absolutely right about that If we look at the tranche of children who have still not got into education we see that they tend to be the children who are disabled or who are in more nomadic tribes and it is harder for them to get into education We are clear that a core ethos underpinning the next development framework needs to be about leaving nobody behind My Department is pulling together the first ever DFID strategy on how addressing disability should be part of our development programme So she is right to raise the issue and I can certainly reassure her that this Government have started to bring that issue into our programming more centrally In July we will convene in Ethiopia to agree a new financing agenda for development Of course the UK Government have in this Parliament for the first time ever finally met their commitment to spend 0 7 of our GNI on international development In September on the 70th anniversary of the United Nations we will meet in New York to agree the elements of the post 2015 development framework up to 2030 In December the world will come together in Paris to agree a binding international treaty to tackle the global dangers of climate change I am proud to be part of a Government who are taking a leading part in all of those negotiations Let me briefly discuss the post 2015 agenda The international community has a duty to produce a set of equally inspiring goals and targets to run up to 2030 that will put us on a sustainable development pathway to eradicate extreme poverty within a generation The UK has played a leading role in that process not least demonstrating our commitment to international development by finally meeting the commitment we made to spend 0 7 Indeed that is recognised by the fact that the UN Secretary General Ban Ki moon personally asked our Prime Minister together with President Johnson Sirleaf of Liberia and the then President Yudhoyono of Indonesia to co chair the high level panel of experts who were asked to review these issues and to publish a report about how we should pull together the next sustainable development framework

It is probably true to say that the Scottish Labour party was not quite successful in last month s Scottish parliamentary elections but that was not because of our policies on jobs employment or apprenticeships most people recognised that those were our top priority There were other reasons why we did not quite win I do not think that it was because of our position on getting young people back into employment

Teachers with the specialised training who are needed to teach a child with severe autism for example are a specialist resource I agree that parents ask for people with those skills but they are much more likely to find them in special schools because that is where they are concentrated Sadly the chances of finding them in mainstream schools are much lower The facts are clear and the Government should accept their responsibility for what is going on Across the country local authorities are implementing the policies that the Government have been imposing since their first policy statement on the subject in 1997 which said that we shall promote the inclusion of children with SEN within mainstream schooling On this matter at least the Government s policy has been consistent In document after document they have said that wherever possible they want children with special needs to be educated in mainstream schools That is what the Government s guidance on inclusive schooling is all about their 2004 document stated that the proportion of children educated in special schools should fall over time That is the Government s aim Ministers should not try to dispute the statistics instead they should admit that we are confronted today with the consequences of the Government s deliberate policy

Yes I think I can provide that reassurance to my right hon Friend An organisation that can make better use of technology and improve the way it works will find that there are some activities that it currently performs for which it requires large numbers of staff but that it will not necessarily need those staff members in future There are however a number of things that HMRC does that will mean that it requires those staff members HMRC will become a more highly skilled organisation It will need highly talented people to be able to ensure that we get the money in My right hon Friend provides a good example There may be people currently working in for example Chelmsford who have skills that HMRC needs They will be able to work in Stratford I can point to other examples of similar circumstances throughout the United Kingdom

Several issues have been raised in this important debate but I wish to address two main points Whiplash claims have been a chronic problem in British insurance and road usage for some time Eight years ago I joined the Transport Committee and I served on it for three years We looked into the issue more than once and found that whiplash claims had gone up in England so we looked across Europe What has not been mentioned in the debate is that were Members to look at whiplash rates across the continent of Europe they would be astonished at how low the incidence of whiplash is The Transport Committee looked at the issue including whiplash rates in Germany five years ago I notice the newly appointed Whip my hon Friend the Member for Milton Keynes South Iain Stewart nodding in agreement He served on the Committee as well and will remember that we looked into whiplash in Europe and were astonished at the low incidence of claims across the continent That cannot be because somehow the necks in Germany are more robust than those in Britain It cannot be a question of Germans being physically different from people in Britain The case was clearly made that we had a problem with whiplash claims that was specific to the United Kingdom My hon Friend the Member for South Norfolk Mr Bacon mentioned the fact that Aviva issued a report more than 10 years ago Yes I know that Aviva is a bad evil insurance company that makes profits that is successful and that employs people I know that that is all to be deprecated but the fact is that its report suggested more than 10 years ago that there was a problem with whiplash The facts speak for themselves The idea that over 10 years we could have a 30 reduction in accidents and yet a 40 increase in whiplash claims seems incredible It cannot be the case that they are inversely correlated It cannot be the case that as there were fewer accidents we would have more whiplash claims from accidents That does not make any sense whatsoever I am afraid that the Opposition Members who have spoken have failed to address that Given the fact that the Transport Committee looked into the issue four or five years ago and that people issued reports more than 10 years ago about whiplash being a problem and given that we know as Opposition Members acknowledge that unscrupulous claims companies are cold calling people I suggest to Opposition Members that they cannot have it both ways It cannot be the case that the whiplash increase is simply a scare story whipped up by the insurance industry and at the same time the claims companies are cold calling and being equally unscrupulous It has to be one or the other The insurers cannot be suggesting that it is fraudulent while compensation claims companies are at the same time pushing fraudulent claims The two go together The Bill is timely indeed it is long overdue in respect of the measures on whiplash claims My hon Friend the Member for Croydon South Chris Philp was quite right that it cannot simply be a blank cheque for insurers The Government have to look more closely at how the insurance companies are going to pass on some of the perceived and anticipated benefits of reducing whiplash claims and ultimately reduce premiums for consumers I fully appreciate that in many ways it has been quite a difficult time for the insurance industry Insurance premium tax has gone up from 6 at the beginning of the decade to 12 That is greater taxation Some of us have argued against such steep increases but those increases have happened The idea that somehow the insurance industry is a den of profiteers or a wicked industry that acts against the interests of our constituents is silly it is a crazy idea It is a very successful British industry and something that we should be supporting It is one of a number of industries not a huge number of industries in which we are world leaders so it is very disappointing to hear once again the industry being denigrated by Opposition Members

The hon Lady has considerable knowledge of transport issues as a result of her role on the Transport Committee and I think she understands that what the Government are doing is freeing up local councils to spend their own money rather than determining the number of grant schemes centrally There have been 26 grant streams for transport funding for local authorities but that will be reduced to four That will enable local authorities to prioritise matters in their own areas as they should do as democratically elected bodies

I am delighted with that news because the Government have given great support to Siemens and DONG Energy We have I think the biggest offshore wind market in the world because we have provided the regulatory certainty the industry needed In the east of England that has achieved not just one big factory but the industrial regeneration of all the related industries Irrespective of the outcome of the referendum we have to make Britain the best place in the world to invest and grow a business When the arguments come I am sure many of those who want us to stay in a reformed EU will argue it will make us even more attractive but we should wait until the starting gun is fired

My hon Friend tempts me too far on this issue but I strongly agree with him that we have a massive strategic national interest in a two way flow of students students from Britain going elsewhere in the European Union and other EU students coming to this country But it is important to make it clear that although we welcome those overseas students it is right that on leaving their courses all those who can contribute to the cost of their higher education should do so regardless of what country they are from and where they choose to live The arrangements that we have announced this week will ensure that that happens

Having had that ample demonstration of the sovereignty of the United Kingdom the Prime Minister deserves our congratulations on that statement given the opposition from within the European Union for example I can now resume the previous debate As I said I want to cover a number of practical examples It would be fair to say that 60 or 70 of all our legislation now comes from the European Union When Members are debating Bills there is frequently almost invariably no way for them to know whether the legislation emanates from EU law When I was a member of the Statutory Instruments Committee many years ago I managed to instigate a system to ensure that legislation emanating from the European Union was denoted by an asterisk to show where it came from It would be extremely helpful for MPs to have that included in all Bills for convenience perhaps it could be in the explanatory notes because if we are not entitled to legislate inconsistently with European law MPs should know that As for the proposals in this Bill and the clause that I suggested might be added to it we come back to the notwithstanding formula which has been brought up about half a dozen times in the last hour and a half it is important that people should know the extent to which we are trammelled in our legislation Indeed many Acts of Parliament would be better understood by the public at large if they knew where the obligations came from That is one practical point The other practical questions relate to the diversity magnitude and volume of such legislation We hear a great deal about better deregulation and attempts within the European Union to regulate better but the statistics are incredibly bad There is virtually no deregulation going on in the European Union despite the fact that my right hon Friend the Prime Minister has placed a great deal of faith in renegotiating legislation some of which has a very damaging effect on our potential for growth In fact I have recently quoted Lord Mandelson who said when he was Trade Commissioner that over regulation from the European Union amounts to 4 of GDP and Mr Verheugen has demonstrated that over regulation costs many billions of pounds The most recent calculation I have seen is that since 1999 European over regulation has cost the British economy and British business alone 124 billion This is absolute madness We are talking about over regulation and unnecessary regulation the manner in which it is passed and whether on the basis of what the Government say I would be fascinated to know how the Minister will respond to this there is any intention whatever of following the precept that the Prime Minister If I can detach the Minister from his colleague I would like to draw his attention to a point to which I would like him to respond

As a former entrepreneur as in my entry in the Register of Members Financial Interests I did not benefit from this particular relief but many in that community do benefit from it Does the hon Gentleman believe that this should be scrapped which would penalise people who start businesses in this country and go on to employ people who then pay taxes and put food on the table for their families Is the position of the Labour party to be completely anti entrepreneurs

That has been part of the discussion throughout the day I have to say that I missed some of the speeches I am sorry to hear what the hon Gentleman had to say but I simply do not agree with his basic premise I have travelled the route met local communities along the route and met local government leaders and local businesses along the route I simply do not agree with his premise The issues raised by colleagues along the line of the route are of course entirely fair and legitimate and they are right to speak up for their constituents It is difficult delivering infrastructure whether it is transport digital or housing infrastructure without causing some environmental impact It is clearly right for the Minister to listen to the concerns raised by Members and to respond appropriately I know that when I was part of the Transport team we did nothing but listen and try to address those issues I know that the Under Secretary of State for Transport my hon Friend the Member for Wealden Ms Ghani will be in the same grain Despite all the sensitivities that have been raised it is very encouraging that we have a Government who are seeking to deliver HS2 as fast as possible and have brought forward HS2 phase 2a Views have been well articulated today The reasons why I am so supportive of the development are that it will deliver key strategic benefits for the UK in terms of economic growth and the skills legacy I have visited the two HS2 colleges in Doncaster and in Birmingham only during their construction phase not since they have progressed further and I was incredibly impressed by what I saw They offer great facilities for skills development for people taking apprenticeships They will learn all the skills that we will need not just for this project but for future high speed rail projects

I just want to make a couple of brief statements and I apologise for not being present during the opening speeches but I was actually speaking at a conference on vulnerable workers I just ask the Government to let the negotiators negotiate When the civil service unions attended the scheme s talks this week they were told what they can and cannot discuss They cannot discuss pension age despite the previous assurances that Ministers have given them All schemes have to relate to the state pension age so even though some schemes may be able to afford a pension age of 65 years old the Government are refusing to allow them even to negotiate it The unions are also told that indexation is off the agenda and that the index has to be CPI not earnings as Hutton recommended or RPI as currently The schemes have to be career average The civil service unions are not allowed to discuss contributions which have to increase by 3 2 so that the average contribution is 5 6 Costs always have to be within the scheme s limit but in addition the only transitional protection that they can discuss is 10 years for those aged 50 plus the three to four years of tapering for those just below that age Even if the unions find savings they cannot use them in another way for further protection They cannot discuss Treasury assumptions about the discount rate actuarial reductions for early retirement or any normal pension scheme issues They are told also that they cannot discuss the abatement rules which enable staff to take their accrued pension and work on They can discuss the accrual rate but that is all pre determined by the other elements not being open for negotiation So what the civil service unions are allowed to discuss in the negotiations is nothing of substance and in reality we face further industrial action because the Government will not allow negotiations to take place The Government take an intimidatory attitude by putting things on the agenda and if they do not get their way then taking them off I echo what other Members have said about the contempt with which negotiators have been treated I watched the discussion between the Minister for the Cabinet Office and Paymaster General the right hon Member for Horsham Mr Maude and Mark Serwotka the general secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union when the Minister accused him of not being at meetings I now discover that Mark Serwotka was at every meeting that the Minister was at matched on every occasion If the Government are not deliberately provoking this dispute they are walking into further industrial action because of their refusal to allow negotiations to take place I have toured around talking to individual unions and I have spoken to several union executives this week but the depth of anger does not come from general secretaries or from executives it comes from rank and file trade unionists most of whom have never taken industrial action in their lives but all of whom are dedicated to the public service that they seek to provide So I just appeal to the Government start negotiating properly allow proper discussions to take place seek to avoid industrial action stop the abuse the damp squib provocations that the Prime Minister has made and start telling the truth about what people are going to get because they are going to work longer get less and pay more If we look at the calculations that have been made using the Government s own calculator we find that no one will get more unless they work for many more years and teachers and others do not want to work until they are 68 years old just to get some form of pension income that they can live off I urge the Government to get back to the negotiating table and to take their restrictions off the negotiations They are dealing with people who are dedicated to public service who are willing to settle and who do not want to seek further industrial action I warn the Government that if they do not negotiate properly there will inevitably be more disruption and more industrial action and that the Government will be to blame for it

It is a great pleasure to follow my hon Friend the Member for Dewsbury Simon Reevell who has given us a salutary reminder of the importance of defence He and I share a profession and I have to say that this is the first defence debate that I have attended in my 10 years in the House I say so not out of pride but out of shame as well as to emphasise the growing unease I have felt from reading and listening to such important debates it has been a privilege to listen to the speeches of hon Members from both sides of the House I am now better informed and perhaps even a little wiser and more enlightened but none of them allayed my anxieties or convinced me not to make the effort to attend the debate this afternoon I must say that my only qualification a tenuous one for speaking in a defence debate is that my father was a career soldier and that I was brought up on Army bases and camps around the world in the 1960s He was a gunner for 40 years and left the Army only in the mid 1980s The experience of growing up within the Army taught me not only its values its ethics its morality its discipline and its code but that it was essential to the very fabric of this country for us to maintain our armed forces in a state of readiness and properly resourced to be able to defend its people Following my increasing concern over the past few years I have to say that I am no longer convinced that we give our defence forces the priority that they require I should not have been in the Chamber this afternoon with the Under Secretary of State for Defence my hon Friend the Member for Ludlow Mr Dunne who has responsibility for defence equipment support and technology I should have been in Appledore visiting the last English shipbuilder which is just completing its third Irish I stress Irish naval patrol vessel having already completed the bow sections of both of the carriers I believe that our visit would have been widely welcomed by the 400 or 500 strong work force of that shipyard because they feel that the defence establishment should nurture the last remaining skill bases that exist for the production of naval vessels and ships I am grateful to the Minister for having expressed his wish to visit and I hope that he will visit after the election and I hope that he will still be in his present job or some even more senior and illustrious position My purpose today is not to contribute to the weight of opinion authority and expertise that I have been awestruck to listen to this afternoon but by appearing here today as the representative of a sedentary and dusty trade a long way removed from the military or the armed forces to demonstrate to the Government including Ministers from my party that the issue of defence is not a specialised interest confined merely to a few dozen of our colleagues It was suggested earlier that those present are defence enthusiasts but concern about defence is spreading widely not only through the Conservative party but the country It would be wrong of us to believe that it is a specialised interest of significance only to a narrow circle it is becoming ever more widespread I attend this debate not to send a message to my hon Friend the Minister who I know grasps these points but to those in charge of the Treasury that enough is enough and that 2 is a line in the sand Beyond it we must not go It represents a demonstration of will and the fulfilment of a commitment and no amount of creative accounting sneaking or ducking and diving will deflect the attention of the British people from the solemn responsibility of this Government and the next to defend our interests and the integrity of our borders I say to my hon Friend as a messenger to those who sit in Cabinet and have the decision making power in the councils of the Government that if we were to compromise that 2 the message it would send to the dictators and the enemies of freedom and all the values and principles we hold dear is that we are no longer willing to stand by our commitments and to pay the price of freedom I agree with those who have said that to do business in terms of proportions and percentages of GDP is not good politics but we have made the 2 figure the line in the sand We have said it to other countries and we cannot now compromise on our determination to fulfil our responsibility to the international community If we allow ourselves to become weak impliedly we expect others to take up to the same measure and in the same proportion the burden of defending us That has never been Britain s way and cannot be the way that this House regards as appropriate I ask all my hon Friends to hold the Government to the 2 commitment and not to let it go

The hon Gentleman speaks powerfully of the importance of the self employed to our economy We pay tribute to the excellent work that so many self employed people including many in my family do to generate economic growth in this country He is right that as wages across the economy grow and as we put more spending power into budgets for social and residential care we expect that to be passed on to those who are self employed

I passionately agree with the hon Lady I taught at Cranfield School of Management for seven years although we never got too deep into the soil at that point because we were busy trying to start businesses She is right to suggest that we have a long database of soil systems A lot of people in this country like to collect things and keep them and that is a great thing to have We have samples that go back 100 years in some cases I want to talk about our carbon budget The IPCC has calculated that a budget of 420 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide would give us a two thirds chance of staying within 1 5 C and that a 580 gigatonne budget would give us a 50 50 chance of doing so Those are not betting odds If I were told that I had a 50 50 chance of something happening I would not think those are great odds so 580 gigatonnes is not a good budget to have This larger budget 580 gigatonnes is the equivalent of 10 years of global emissions at 2017 levels To achieve that the global production and consumption of coal must fall by 80 again we have done important and good things on that in our country and the global production and consumption of oil and gas must fall by 50 by 2030 That is why I have come to the conclusion that fracking is not compatible with the 12 years we have left and it is why I regret that it is being treated as a national infrastructure project rather than onshore wind which has the power to give us the clean energy we need We know there is uncertainty and we know there are tipping points We do not know what will happen if we get to 1 5 but we know that for example if the permafrost thaws releasing methane or if the sea ice collapses these things can accelerate We can tackle emissions and deliver healthier cities healthier people and a healthier planet The Committee s latest inquiry on planetary health is looking at how these complex systems deliver We have seen exponential growth of wind and solar and we are experiencing an industrial revolution We have done things we thought impossible 10 or 12 years ago for which I pay tribute to politicians on both sides of the House The revolution is happening at the speed of the technological revolution which is good Big data will help us in this fight too but we will need renewable energy to supply between 70 and 80 of all global power by 2050 In this country we have done a lot on electricity but the Committee on Climate Change has said that this progress has masked failures in other areas We have seen very small reductions in agriculture and buildings related emissions At a time when Persimmon is paying its chief executive 75 million we have to ask why we are subsidising the Help to Buy scheme Why are we not subsidising ground source or air source heat pumps as is happening in Sweden to make sure we have zero carbon homes

I do not know about you Mr Speaker but I am a half full man and the Scottish nationalists seem to be talking about half empty glasses I think the hon Gentleman is quoting extremely selectively from the answer I gave him and for what it is worth I share his disappointment about the SME performance I do not believe the figures or trust them because they are extraordinarily low I have seen the vibrancy of the Scottish defence sector for myself on a number of visits and I believe that the share of business is much higher I invite the hon Gentleman to abandon his ludicrous plans for an independent Scotland and join me in building a still more robust defence industrial base in Scotland rather than talking it down all the time

I fully agree A family in poverty in a wealthy rural community will feel a sense of social isolation and children at school will see their friends get certain things and so on I was going to say when I tried to intervene on the hon Member for Barnsley Central I understand why the intervention was not taken that this sort of Bill could be developed potentially in future debates to include provisions about educational attainment Poverty can almost be a double hit Someone may grow up in a deprived family but many pupils on free school meals also do not do well in our education system I remember a speech by the right hon Member for Surrey Heath Michael Gove in which he pointed out that fewer pupils in the entire free school meals cohort attained three grade As the passport to a top university than the pupils at Eton did in the same year That is why for me I am aware of the time but the Minister would have spoken to the mark anyway I felt it was appropriate for there to be a speech on why it is not only Labour Members and Scottish National party Members who are pleased to see the Bill A number of Conservative Back Benchers are pleased to it and I hope that these ideas can be taken forward at another time The debate stood adjourned Standing Order No 11 2 Ordered That the debate be resumed on Friday 24 February

It is a great pleasure to conclude this debate which has been a positive and constructive debate on a very vital subject I think it is fair to say that on the majority of the issues there is genuine cross party consensus We have identified the challenges that we face and we are looking to find as many opportunities as possible to move forward I am proud to serve in a Government where the Prime Minister personally committed us to halving the disability employment gap Our Secretary of State has shown a genuine passion to understand listen and engage with the stakeholders those with the first hand experience of how we can identify the opportunities and overcome the challenges I am confident that we will continue to make a real difference in this vital area In the past two years alone 365 000 more disabled people have entered into work This is crucial for a number of reasons as I find when I engage with stakeholders particularly young stakeholders The hon Member for Airdrie and Shotts Neil Gray mentioned his nephew who is taking his GCSE exams I join in the good luck messages to him That summed up exactly why this is so important Disabled people rightly wish to be judged on their ability not their disability I say that as an individual who has not only employed disabled people but benefited from doing so We have to look at businesses My hon Friend the Member for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport Oliver Colvile highlighted one of the key areas which is that we have a skills shortage in this country If businesses have the confidence to make the necessary changes often they are small ones they will benefit If more disabled people can get into work disabled people and businesses will benefit It is a genuine win win situation Key for the Government and key in my role is to make sure that we showcase talent share best practice and create genuine opportunities I will quickly whizz through some of the highlights of the work that we are already doing There is a real terms increase in support to help those with disabilities and long term health conditions to seek work We are reforming Jobcentre Plus We have the hidden impairment toolkit and additional training We have doubled the number of disability advisers We have commissioned the 43 million mental health pilots including the collocation of improving access to psychological therapies The new Work and Health unit rightly brings together the greatest minds in DWP and the Department of Health something that has been greatly welcomed by our stakeholder groups In that we have already commissioned pilots on the innovation portfolios with a real focus on mental health support the personalisation pathfinders and the peer to peer support that our stakeholders repeatedly highlight as crucial Disability Rights UK has helped to lead on those pilots The hon Member for East Kilbride Strathaven and Lesmahagow Dr Cameron who does great work as the chair of the all party group on disability also recognises the importance of peer to peer support With the reforms and the introduction of universal credit the area that I am most excited about is having a named coach for the first time As individuals navigate their way over the challenges of getting into the workplace they will have a named coach to support them to find work and to get additional support When they are in work for the first time they will have continued support to help them to achieve genuine career progression I welcome the increased focus from the Health and Safety Executive for which I am also responsible Its title includes health and safety and on safety it is world leading foreign countries and foreign businesses pay for our expertise in improving safety but there is also a real focus on the health side recognising that we lose 131 million days a year to ill health There will be a huge amount of additional work in that area The HSE has fantastic business engagement Businesses of all sizes small medium sized and large proactively engage with it and we want to utilise that

I very much respect what my hon Friend says He took part in a Westminster Hall debate on the issue and I am sure the Chancellor and other colleagues are listening to him We need to be clear though about whether he is arguing for a needs based assessment across the whole UK The hon Member for Glasgow Central Anas Sarwar drew attention to the fact that there are significant differentials within England The difference between the highest and lowest per capita public spending in England is 2 537 which is much greater than the difference between the Scottish and English average We need to be clear about whether my hon Friend and those who make the same argument want a change in spending within England or just between the constituent parts of the UK

New clause 1 presents an opportunity I congratulate my right hon Friends on the Opposition Front Bench on getting it agreed with the Government but of course there are weaknesses and flaws that my right hon Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East Paul Goggins has outlined There are genuine concerns based on constituency surgeries telephone calls and e mails about people being wrongly or unfairly sanctioned I quoted a case in which the benefits of a constituent who attended the funeral of a brother were stopped I contacted the DWP and got that changed but it should never have happened There are other cases that cause great concern People who can work should work and should be helped to do so Clearly it would help if there were more jobs around for people to get into work in the first place That is an issue in areas such as mine and elsewhere but if someone persistently and for no good reason refuses to take a job or look for one sanctions should apply However in a number of instances sanctions are being operated unfairly Mental health is a matter of particular importance We say a lot on the Floor of the House about how we want to support better those who suffer from mental health problems and how the system should take the issue more seriously From the evidence that is presented to me in the surgeries in my constituency this is one area where the decisions taken to sanction people are particularly hard Mental health affects a range of people but particularly young single men I have concerns about how the system works and how those with mental health issues are sanctioned and given penalties It is important that the review process takes this serious matter into consideration and the Government need to provide some impetus to that I visited a food bank in my constituency recently There are a growing number of single men using the food bank they are struggling to survive There are referrals from jobcentre plus for people who need food to be able to continue It is a concern that people who have no money are receiving penalties What do the Government think should happen then particularly for those who have mental health family or social problems The hon Member for Beckenham Bob Stewart made a point about illiteracy In the poorer areas of the country in constituencies such as mine there are still significant problems relating to illiteracy because people have poor reading or writing skills or perhaps cannot read That impacts on people s ability to interact with the system and unfairly works against them Whether they are former soldiers or other people it is a problem that has not been properly addressed I hope that the review will consider that as well I am concerned about the time scale which is why I put my name to the amendments tabled by my right hon Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East I accept what the Minister said that this has to be done properly but I see no reason why an interim review could not be carried out We need to get to the bottom of this because every day people are being unfairly penalised We need to look at the system and get it changed as quickly as possible The terms of reference of the review are also crucial so I hope that the Minister will bear it in mind when the Bill goes to the Lords or on another occasion that we need to see and have some input into the terms of reference I feel strongly that the review will be an important part of our consideration of the whole system I hope that the Minister will consider those problems We are here because the Government got the legislation wrong as they have got it wrong elsewhere on welfare for example we know of disabled children whose families are affected by the bedroom tax on which the Court of Appeal ruled The Government are getting these things wrong and the most vulnerable people in our society are suffering as a result of the mistakes in the Government s welfare policy I hope that they will reconsider some of these issues and how they want to proceed

I apologise for missing some of the Front Bench speeches I shall make a brief contribution Because there was a measurable improvement in the behaviour of English fans after the 2000 Act the temptation is to believe that the improvement was due to the Act It is understandable that the Government should claim that but let us consider the origins of the Act and the reasons for its introduction It arose from three football matches There might well be an alternative interpretation of the extraordinary differences in the reaction of English football fans after two of those matches compared with the other one At two of those matches one in Belgium and the other in France there was an expectation of violence The police turned up in riot gear the fans were allowed to drink double strength beer which they did in prodigious quantities and inevitably there was a riot At the other game the police arrived in leisure wear they played pop music to the fans so loud that the fans could not even hear their own chants and they allowed them to indulge in a drug whose effect is very different from that of alcohol Alcohol inspires football fans to give each other a good kicking The drug used in Holland makes them want to give each other a big hug The result was that in the Dutch game according to the police the fans reacted to England s defeat we should remember that these are the same fans who rioted in the other countries with mild disappointment and polite applause That is rather remarkable given that a few days earlier they had reacted violently Although one respects the claims that the legislation is effective it has many drawbacks In future we might be able to copy the example of the Dutch police with pop music and their informal and friendly approach to the fans We hope that in the more enlightened future the fans will be able to use a drug that does not make them violent but has a calming effect

My right hon Friend is very kind in his words May I reciprocate by saying that he has done much work to keep this debate alive The Defence Secretary is absolutely passionate about this As I said earlier we need to share this further beyond defence colleagues and beyond those who naturally find this important and understand it or indeed who have constituencies that are connected with the armed forces This is something on which we need to engage with the nation We need to recognise that it is part of our DNA to be strong to be firm and to be leaders in Europe and on the international stage itself I hope that that message is being shared in NATO at the summit now

I can recall many Labour Health Ministers telling us from the Dispatch Box that local decisions were made by primary care trusts and were not a matter for them Will the Minister consider what he has told us about the CAMHS review He has been frank about the fact that CAMHS are dysfunctional and broken Surely the review is the opportunity to lay down a route map and set out how we can deliver the preventive early intervention services that prevent the crisis from occurring in the first place and the need for the admission Do we not need that so that when there is a spending review after the general election there is clarity about the investment needs for children s mental health

I thank the hon Gentleman for the kind words at the beginning of his speech although it went downhill thereafter I simply do not agree with what he has just said When I have come to the House to announce a significant further increase in expenditure on flood defence it is pretty churlish of him to have a go at the new Prime Minister I would hope that the House would welcome our determination Many Members in the Chamber represent areas that have been affected by flooding and all will welcome the increase in investment I accept that the system was overwhelmed that is true The hon Gentleman is right to draw attention to the considerable impact of surface water as well as river flooding As I indicated previously however even the best defences in the world will sometimes be over topped and overwhelmed by such concentrated rainfall The arrangements put in place are therefore not at fault In the end the cause is a lot of rain and the House needs to recognise that I have already said that there are other lessons to be learned and we will do so I cannot with respect to the hon Gentleman undertake to forecast which places might be likely to flood in the future because that depends on where it rains and what happens but I accept that further work needs to be done to improve the quality of the information available about where particular properties are at risk We will publish the path to the figure of 800 million in 2010 11 later but I want to correct the hon Gentleman on one point We did not cut the capital budget for expenditure on flood defence and it is important that I make that clear to the House

No I will not Devolution to councils is being held up either because they are incapable of dealing with it or because they are not performing well neither is acceptable and I would expect this to be dealt with as it has been in the Bill It is time for our councils to deliver This approach is all part of encouraging councils but there can be no doubt that our historical under supply of homes over some 20 years at least is the result of a planning system that is not fit for purpose That was the conclusion of the Barker review of housing supply in 2004 The Killian Pretty review in 2008 found that only five out of 64 planning applications went ahead without difficulties with the rest often having substantial problems that either delayed them or changed the nature of the development According to the National Audit Office planning laws create the highest regulatory costs of any type of regulation The Opposition have thus totally missed the point of localism which was the double devolution down to local communities which are engaging in the production of their own local plans they are empowered to do so and they are seizing those opportunities fully with both hands to make the best of them Clause 4 deals with the information requirements There is a sense that the clause is unnecessary because other more general powers are available to ask for the right amount of information when looking at an application but that is utter nonsense Information requirements are now pretty wide We have all sat through planning committees where the information requested has been wide of the mark and in particular has borne no relation to what might be a material consideration I am grateful that the Bill has included information that will be a material consideration in the terms of the information that will be collected

I was just coming to that precise point I believe that it was raised this afternoon by the hon Gentleman speaking sotto voce from a sedentary position and by the Home Secretary It seems from the right hon Gentleman s comments that he too knows that denunciation can be done but has decided that it should not be done He resorted to the argument that the hon Gentleman has just repeated Our legal advice such as it is is that under article 59 as long as the United Kingdom remains a member of the Council of Europe we would be able to re accede after denunciation We can go beyond that Today s report from the Home Affairs Committee also refers to the issue and paragraph 20 clearly says It would be desirable for the Home Secretary who is accountable to Parliament to be able to exercise his discretion within the framework of Article 3 Again we agree However the Committee states that after having said that it thinks that the Government should engage in a review with our European partners with a view to finding some acceptable solution that might avoid the need to exercise a power of indefinite detention That would indeed achieve the same ends If by following that proposal we could avoid denunciation which I accept is a fairly dramatic option that would be more acceptable However unless the Minister can convince us otherwise there is no evidence that the Government have embarked on any such discussions with fellow members of the Council of Europe

The clock is ticking in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where elections are still nowhere on the horizon despite the agreement at the end of last year that they should be held within one year The United Kingdom has been highly engaged in the process Could we have a statement from the Minister responsible perhaps a written statement or some kind of indication during the recess about what we can do to ensure that the Democratic Republic of the Congo does not fall into a period of great uncertainty but holds the promised elections

Let me point out that it was the Opposition who raised the question of boom and bust When the hon Gentleman compares the last world slowdown with this he will note that when the economy went into recession in 1990 it was impossible to cut interest rates because inflation was running at 10 per cent It was also impossible to take the action that was necessary on the fiscal side when it could have been taken The hon Gentleman should look at the record of the last Conservative Government when he tries to suggest that there is boom and bust under this Government It is quite the opposite The policy we are pursuing is one of stability This year that policy has yielded a growth rate of we believe 2¼ per cent and we are forecasting a rate of 2 to 2½ per cent next year That is not boom and bust that is an economy which is trying to achieve a degree of stability that we have not had during previous world downturns

I do not think that my statement could be any clearer which is why I wanted to set out the policy in detail The Chancellor said that he pledged to demonstrate the strength of national purpose in protecting our security in this parliament and in the long term He said that we would be strong in defence in fighting terrorism upholding NATO supporting our armed forces at home and abroad and retaining our independent nuclear deterrent Let me also quote the hon Member for New Forest East Dr Lewis He said that last night s speech was just more spin designed to cast the Chancellor as a statesman Well the Chancellor is a statesman He represents this country at the very highest levels of international negotiations and he does it exceptionally well He is not the political pygmy he is a world statesman The hon Gentleman also said that the Chancellor was reheating an old pledge to retain the current deterrent but not committing to replacing the independent nuclear deterrent when it reaches the end of its current life

I welcome the 800 million in Barnett consequentials which the Scottish Government will invest on top of the 100 million they have already announced for capital projects but what further steps will the Chancellor take to address the almost 10 cut to the Scottish capital budget since the Tories came to office

I think the MEP concerned is demonstrating a certain amount of wishful thinking Our position remains that we are not prepared to accept anything beyond 2 9 and the Prime Minister was able to win the support of 12 other Heads of Government for that position at the recent European summit

I can say very clearly to the hon Lady that I do not agree with that position Smart meters will have a great future in this country We discussed in earlier questions energy security and fuel poverty Smart meters will be a very good way for people to reduce their bills and use less energy therefore creating fewer carbon emissions Smart meters are an important part of that

I can see why the hon Gentleman says that and there is always a risk that that might be the case Interestingly when I met the Bulgarian Minister in charge of EU funds that was precisely not his attitude because clearly there is a debate about what will happen to structural and cohesion funds in future given that new member states are now involved and want to see investment to help grow their economies They also want value for money they do not want billions of pounds handed over if it makes no difference on the ground As member states we need to drive that agenda and point out that it is unacceptable for a 16th audit report not to be given the statement of assurance At the same time we must have a positive agenda to work with member states to improve not only our own ability to control the finances and funds that come from the EU but the ability of other member states to do so

I agree with my hon Friend s point about targeting help particularly on building maintenance and repair and on tourism Does he agree that one benefit of such targeting is that it would take effect very quickly and would be likely to help small business and small traders Many of the housing measures announced yesterday were welcome but they will mainly benefit the bigger builders The VAT cuts that my hon Friend is suggesting would provide a quick way of boosting the economy and helping many of the people who need help now

Like the hon Member for North Norfolk Norman Lamb I speak from a rural perspective Not for the first time I am standing in this House having just listened to a Labour Member talking about the services available in her constituency and feeling that I inhabit a different world The Minister has been very helpful in the past when I have had cause to raise issues relating to different health problems in my constituency I know from that contact with her and with Ministers generally that they are invariably decent and well intentioned people I make no bones about conceding that I am sure that the Government intend to try to raise standards in this field to promote its profile and to invest in it However I have to say to the Minister with great respect that as I listened to her speech I was struck by the enormous gulf between the tone and tenor of her remarks and the urgency of the problems that I experience in the surgeries that I conduct every week in my constituency These are all real cases There is the frightened child with anorexia who finds herself in a ward with adults There is the schizophrenic 19 year old who will not take the drugs to control his condition and is living at home with his mother who cannot find help at the weekend as she watches him decline into despair Does the Minister think that it is good enough to have crisis intervention between 9 o clock and 5 o clock at weekends Those are the hours at weekends when the crisis team operates in Tavistock in my constituency Someone who rings up at 10 past 5 will not get anybody at the crisis team and will have to ring DevonDoc the out of hours doctors service When this mother rang up DevonDoc she was told Take him to A and E The A and E department is 25 miles away She received no support at the weekend and as a consequence like some kind of fatal unravelling that young man was eventually sectioned and found himself in hospital There is the anguished father whose son is drinking himself to death in front of his young children and an exhausted wife who has patiently tried through love and care to bring him round but can find no permanent and sustained assistance in my constituency or in my area There is the autistic 30 year old who after school and college has received no help no provision and precious little understanding and who is beginning to become depressed about the way in which he is treated isolated in a small rural village There are the families of autistic children for whom every day is a battle to secure the education speech therapy and occupational therapy that their child needs Sometimes there is no support even in the basic task of communicating with their children who are insulated in a world that is impossible to penetrate Those are the experiences of my constituents I noted similar experiences of similar problems from the contributions of Liberal Democrat Members who represent rural areas such as mine some just across the border in Cornwall To those watching from a distance in Cornwall and in Devon the Minister s speech will not have risen to the height of their problems and daily experiences They simply do not have the services or access to the services about which the hon Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch Meg Hillier spoke a moment ago They feel isolated abandoned and alone It is not good enough My constituents have begun to take into their own hands the power to do something about their problems I am proud to be a trustee of a charity called Make a Difference in Tavistock It is trying to fill the gap in provision that the service users whom I represent experience daily It runs a café a support group and a social network That provision is barely supported by the responsible trust Those who use the services and the volunteers who support them often in their spare time from working for the trust have taken the initiatives I am therefore proud to be a part of that and proud of all those who are beginning to construct the foundations of recovery by taking into their own hands the power to do something about their problems However the support for them is not there The initiatives are the result of good will and voluntary action by people in the community who care The Bubbly project provides a day centre for those with learning disabilities Two desperate parents of a child with learning disabilities raised their banner in Torridge in the part of north Devon that I represent because day centres there have closed Integration into community hubs and supported living initiatives have simply meant village halls pubs and cafés There is a groundswell of opinion that the policy is not working and is causing a large expansion of mental health problems One cannot close day centres which were centres of excellence energy and activity and the hub of a social network for those with learning disabilities and simply believe that without providing huge amounts of extra resources for the infrastructure and the communities there will be no problems Parents throughout the rural areas that I represent are deeply concerned about the move towards community care and support in the community it simply does not appear to be there Those with learning disabilities are deprived of the genuine help that they can get from day centres The Bubbly project therefore relies on the voluntary action of those who give their time money and effort to attempt to set up something that should be the county council s responsibility and that of the Devon Partnership NHS Trust which is the mental health trust responsible in my constituency Those volunteer actions show the gulf that continues to exist for those with mental health problems in my constituency It is not only those afflicted by psychiatric problems but those with autism as the Minister will understand and those with a wide spectrum of mental health and learning disabilities whose urgent problems do not appear to be being tackled at least in the rural area that I represent by the Government s policies I urge the Minister in her efforts to introduce improvements to examine specifically the genuine problems in rural areas She mentioned rural areas almost in passing I hope that she can pay specific attention to access to services which constitutes a severe problem in the rural areas that I represent

I take the right hon Gentleman s point and of course he can stress that when he makes his contribution but now I want to describe three broad areas in which I am very much in favour of the Bill The Bill imposes a duty to ensure that the judiciary reflects the community I am not talking about good judges or bad judges There is no implication that because a person is a Catholic a Protestant a Unionist a nationalist DUP SDLP or whatever they are any better or worse as a judge I am saying that it is essential especially in a divided community that the whole business of criminal justice is not the preserve of the lawyers it is much too serious to leave it simply to the lawyers much as I respect them Some of the people I knew over the years who became judges people I was very friendly with were killed by the same organisation that I was talking about earlier I can think of four Some who became judges were previously Unionist Ministers and Attorneys General and were excellent judges so I make no point about that but I do want to see a judiciary that reflects the wider society and does not come from a religious academic or social stratum that excludes others How many judges came from outside the grammar school system in Northern Ireland I bet if we looked it up I confess immediately that I have not we would not find one Nor would we find representatives of the ethnic communities Nor are there any ladies there are no women I believe and if there are they are certainly hiding their light under a bushel There is a whole wide concept of making the judiciary reflective of the community that is not tied into political or religious views It is much wider and more important than that The Bill imposes a duty on criminal justice agencies to have regard to international human rights standards I think that the hon Member for North Down Lady Hermon will want to come in on that point no thankfully she has not made the point that she was about to make because I do not have the answer but I will have it at a certain point Perhaps I could do a Secretary of State for now The third area to which I draw attention is the position of the Director of Public Prosecutions The fact that the Bill deals with that too is welcome All three matters should have been dealt with in the original legislation as the criminal justice review required but for long standing reasons they were not

Does the hon Gentleman not agree that the argument comes back to the central point that the measure has completely bypassed any public debate on the circumstances in which Parliament would even contemplate public policy objectives overriding the privacy rights that are implicit in the existing relationship when individuals give information to specific Government Departments We will be dispensing with that without any real debate about the principles and simply creating a system in which such things can be done at will by the Government based on single votes in this House

According to the winter supplementary estimates published two weeks ago the Secretary of State has cut front line funding by more than 1 billion in order to fund a two thirds increase in the running costs of the Defence Procurement Agency Is this not yet another example of how this Government have lost their grip on the procurement process Is it not appalling that at a time when Her Majesty s armed forces are under such strain the Ministry of Defence is having to plunder the front line to cover the endemic cost overruns and delays of the Defence Procurement Agency

I am grateful to the hon Member for Daventry Mr Boswell for tabling the new clause The Criminal Records Bureau exists to help employers in the private public and voluntary sectors correctly to identify candidates who may be unsuitable for certain work particularly work involving regular contact with children or with vulnerable or disabled adults by running background checks against records held by the police the Department of Health and the Department for Education and Skills The employer will ask the candidate or applicant for such a sensitive position to complete a disclosure application form in which he or she is asked to give consent to checks on details against data sources That consent will enable verification of identity and enable the application for CRB checks to be processed Given that the applicant will have consented to the checking process and that clause 22 4 b provides an exemption that enables protected information to be disclosed where the person has agreed to it we do not believe that it is necessary to provide any further protection for those who provide information in response to CRB inquiries An additional safeguard which I mentioned in Standing Committee is that subsection 4 f provides that disclosure is permissible if it is for the purposes of preventing or investigating crime The hon Gentleman will understand that that wide provision is designed to pick up the possibilities that he envisages The second half of the new clause proposes that it be made an offence for an applicant who has a full gender recognition certificate to fail to disclose that fact The disclosure application form contains questions that must be answered and others that require an answer if they are applicable to the person concerned The latter category would include details from which a gender change might be inferred such as details of previous names Failure to provide the information needed to carry out background checks or knowingly to make a false statement is a criminal offence and may result in prosecution The Criminal Records Bureau in response to the Goodwin and I rulings of the European Court of Human Rights which the hon Member for Daventry brought to the attention of the House has decided that a transsexual applicant facing the dilemma of revealing their gender history to an employer or voluntary body can exercise their right to privacy by omitting previous identity details on the disclosure application form itself Instead transsexual people are required to send a separate notification of previous identity details directly to the Criminal Records Bureau which has systems in place enabling the inquiry from the employer or voluntary body and the separate notification to be linked and matched The usual checks will then be triggered I assure the House and the hon Gentleman that the guidance accompanying application forms for the gender recognition panels will make it very clear that failure to provide additional information in support of the disclosure application could result in prosecution That guidance will be similar to the guidance attached to a passport application We therefore believe that the process operated by the CRB properly balances the privacy interest of the transsexual person with the wider interest of checking criminal records so the safeguards sought by the new clause already exist The House will also be aware that the Bichard inquiry is looking into wider issues and should recommendations be made I am sure that we will have an opportunity to discuss what more can be done

I will not take further interventions We have managed to maintain our deterrent while reducing our warheads which as a piece of policy craft should be acknowledged and celebrated We are the only major advanced nuclear country to demonstrate that Moving on to the economic side of the issue we cannot disregard that people well versed in the history of military and civil nuclear engineering will understand clearly the benefits of this industry to my constituents in west and south west Cumbria The expertise amassed over 70 years in Copeland and in Barrow in Furness has cemented our place as world leaders in nuclear technology and knowledge It has provided a basis for highly skilled jobs that have enabled communities to benefit from vast private sector investment such as new nuclear reactors alongside the successor programme in Barrow in Furness Our position as world leaders has been hard earned principally by my hon Friend the Member for Barrow in Furness John Woodcock and me by the trade unions and by decades of work in the nuclear industry Maintaining skills and expertise is crucial to the economic wellbeing and growth not just of my constituency but of my county and indeed the north west of England The Trident replacement is forecast to generate as many as 26 000 jobs throughout the UK with more than 6 000 at the BAE shipyard in Barrow in Furness where the submarines will be built The livelihoods of many people in the south of my constituency depend on the renewal of Trident People who advocate defence diversification we heard from the Secretary of State that the GMB has described that as pie in the sky have yet to put forward a comprehensive plan for how they would achieve that We also have to take into account the impact on smaller companies that make up the supply chain The 2014 update to Parliament on the project states Work done to date has identified over 850 potential suppliers across the UK This underlines the fact that the nuclear deterrent represents a significant national undertaking which is drawing on cutting edge capabilities innovation design and engineering skills available in the UK and is providing employment opportunities and development prospects for a substantial number of apprentices trainees and graduates in a wide range of technical and other disciplines The expertise the cutting edge capabilities and the innovation all have their birthplace in west and south west Cumbria The benefits of those opportunities for thousands of apprentices graduates and trainees will be felt across every single community that I represent Opponents of the renewal of Trident will make the case that the skills can be deployed in other industries without ever really making it clear what those industries are and how they intend to put in place the comprehensive retraining plans necessary to redeploy nuclear workers In fact the proponents of diversification have had nearly four decades to come up with a plan to demonstrate how diversification would work and we are still waiting There is no plan and there never will be a plan We have to approach the world as we find it not as we would want it to be To vote against the renewal of Trident is to vote potentially to put thousands of people out of work to waste knowledge and expertise amassed over decades to neglect our duties to our allies to diminish our ability to defend ourselves and certainly to diminish our standing in the world Britain has proudly punched above its weight on the world stage for centuries We are a global leader We should never step back from this responsibility I find myself in a position where I am proud to support my constituents proud to support my constituency proud to support my country and proud to support Labour party policy in the best traditions of Clement Attlee

It is a real concern This whole subject of the changing nature of work is fundamental and it matters because it gives rise to this question if someone has been working for one of these companies possibly as a gig economy worker but certainly in that grey area between employment and self employment and they suffer the terrible tragedy of bereavement are we really saying particularly if they have been working primarily for one company for many months that they should not enjoy this right That is a key question it is what the whole Taylor review boils down to When we talk about the nature of someone s work most of us have an instinctive understanding of what employment looks like The review puts it well Ultimately if it looks and feels like employment it should have the status and protection of employment In other words those people should have these sorts of rights That is incredibly important I shall not stray from the subject Madam Deputy Speaker but there are a whole load of issues including auto enrolment relating to how we bring greater security to those who are caught up in a flexible and dynamic workforce in which the need for flexibility can sometimes mean that people are exploited To all intents and purposes they have given their employment to one firm yet they have not been given the same security and rights that they would expect for having reduced their own freedoms That is the exchange that underpins an employment contract I hope that my hon Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton will be able to give further information on the extent to which the Bill will benefit those in the specific category of worker They are not the normal self employed if someone starts a business they would not expect to have the same rights but the 1 3 million people whom we know of in the gig economy If they have offered their work on a pseudo employed basis for many months and then suffer bereavement my view is that there is a strong case for suggesting that they should have the same rights as the employed Finally on the amendments relating to the cut off point which is a difficult issue the moral argument that was set out very well by the hon Member for North Ayrshire and Arran is very hard to argue with Who knows precisely what the cost would be of her amendments and those tabled by my hon Friend the Member for Torbay on the cut off point my hon Friend the Member for Mid Worcestershire made an estimate and I am sure it would not be many many millions but I want to understand the extent to which those who would suffer from the cut off point because their child was over 18 would still be protected under the provisions on reasonableness After I intervened on my hon Friend the Member for Croydon South Chris Philp he confirmed that his understanding was that they would be protected as did my hon Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton but I would be grateful if the Minister would confirm that someone would still be protected even if their child was above the cut off point because that is very important In conclusion this is a powerful Bill and our proceedings are a classic example of Parliament coming together to deliver changes that appear small in terms of the legislation and the cost but that will be enormously beneficial to those struck by a pain that is for me beyond understanding I have nothing but the greatest sympathy for those who suffer bereavement We should all be proud of this work I hope that the Bill proceeds and encourage everyone in the House to support it

And hairdressers I should have thought about that one It is a complex picture I pay tribute to the staff dealing with this the RAF and civilians who must work their way through all this We are trying to do what is right in terms of future basing to make sure that we can have a long term future and give that commitment to our personnel both civilian and RAF in relation to their location choice where they buy their house and where they bring up their families

I thank my hon Friend the Member for Walsall North Mr Winnick for securing this debate and for his perceptiveness in obtaining a debate on a Thursday and thus giving us an hour and a half to debate universal jurisdiction Most of us were expecting a 30 minute debate The House will be aware that I have tabled early day motion 502 which has been signed by 101 Members who support it It expresses concern about the restriction of the universal jurisdiction of UK courts in matters of human rights law The background to this case rests as my hon Friend explained on a number of conventions but more recently it has rested on the case of General Pinochet He was in this country on an arms buying spree in 1998 when an extradition warrant was sought by Spain The then Home Secretary he is now the Secretary of State for Justice granted the extradition warrant and General Pinochet was duly arrested He then sought diplomatic immunity as a former Head of State but that was rejected by the British courts The House of Lords in its final judgment asserted that the British courts had universal jurisdiction in matters of human rights law It did so on the basis of an arrest warrant that was granted by a divisional court That is an important step forward in international law Those who have read my early day motion will note that it specifically does not mention any individual case it does not mention the arrest warrant sought in the case of Tzipi Livni It is an attempt to defend a very important principle the right of British courts to arrest people where there is prima facie evidence that they have committed human rights abuses or violated the appropriate United Nations statutes to which this country is also signed up The furore about this matter has arisen it was doubtless what provoked my hon Friend into obtaining this debate because a universal arrest warrant was sought in the case of Ms Livni It was obtained in a divisional court on the basis that there was prima facie evidence that she was a party to crimes against humanity during Operation Cast Lead when Israel bombed Gaza and 1 400 people died I was in Gaza two weeks ago and witnessed still the remnants of that attack The arguments for changing the law seem to be coming from friends of Ms Livni who say that to prevent her from coming to this country would damage relations between Britain and Israel They say that the rights and powers of a court to issue an arrest warrant must therefore be removed and that those powers should be placed in the hands of the Attorney General who would decide whether to issue the warrant or not As I explained in my invention earlier the trend of legislation has been to separate for all time as far as possible the authority of the courts from the interference of politicians That is something to which we all agree The Attorney General is inevitably a politically appointed figure Let us imagine that the Attorney General had to consider whether to issue an arrest warrant in the case of Ms Livni and that somebody or a group of people put pressure on them to do so They would be put under a huge amount of pressure including arguments that it was a diplomatic problem that the Government of Israel and the US objected to it that various Arab countries agreed with it and so on It would no longer be a decision based on prima facie evidence or on the law but a decision based on the diplomatic niceties of the situation and the political pressures under which the Attorney General was put Would the same pressures apply if somebody applied for an arrest warrant on Robert Mugabe I do not know All I know is that it is quite important that we should base this on humanitarian law and that the arrest warrant should be awarded or not on the basis of evidence put before the judge

Absolutely and I am grateful to my hon Friend We actually got resolution 2401 through by consensus It called for a ceasefire and humanitarian access particularly in relation to eastern Ghouta but it applied all over Syria The resolution was then not adhered to by some of the parties who had signed up to it If we are going to make any progress on Syria UN resolutions have to be adhered to

I am glad to be able to raise the issue of services at the Alexandra Hospital in Redditch in the Chamber I hear concerns time and again in public meetings and I thank the local groups such as Save the Alex that are campaigning on this matter In short services at the Alex are inadequate That is not my word but the one used by the independent Care Quality Commission It inspected Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust which includes the Alex Hospital in Redditch in June last year and again found it to be inadequate That represents no change since the last inspection Indeed in 16 areas that the CQC inspects only one was rated good none was outstanding and half were rated inadequate with the remaining requiring improvement That is not good enough On being elected in 2017 I inherited a situation where the trust had already approved a new clinical model for future acute services to which centralisation was key As a result regrettably a number of services including maternity and paediatric care were removed from the Alex and relocated to Worcestershire Royal Hospital Our maternity unit closed in November 2015 and paediatrics was temporarily transferred in September 2016 The new plan which was rubber stamped in 2017 is intended to relieve pressure on both hospitals improve patient safety and address staff shortages but almost two years on from the removal of services and the approval of the new plan it is clear to me that it has not had the intended outcome The hospital is still inadequate and the trust remains in special measures Some services have got worse Patients cannot access services when they need them waiting times are poor and promised investments are not coming to fruition quickly enough Pressure has not been relieved Patient safety is being called into question and staff shortages persist at both sites Since my election I have given NHS bosses and management time to demonstrate to me and my constituents that the new clinical model is beneficial I have done my best to explain to constituents why services were transferred and I have visited the hospital time and again along with my fellow Worcestershire MPs who are here tonight to keep a close eye on developments We have thousands of dedicated and fantastic staff in our hospital I have spoken to many of them and my constituents report time and again that the care they receive is fantastic I thank every single member of staff at the hospital for their work However I do not believe I can continue in good faith to defend the new clinical model It is not delivering for the people of Redditch I secured this debate to press my constituents concerns on the Minister and call for a fresh approach All options must remain on the table

I will try to be as brief as possible so that the debate can be properly concluded This debate goes to the heart of what the NHS is about Many Members of Parliament are deeply frustrated about health plans being hatched in their constituencies but they have very little power to influence events The health service is being atomised by a large number of private interests through private finance initiatives and by a large number of trusts with competing interests We need a properly planned health service rather than the internal market and competition which are at the heart of so many of our problems If the hon Member for Enfield North Nick de Bois were still in his place I could tell him something that would make him even more depressed about the future of Chase Farm hospital As a former member of the late Enfield and Haringey area health authority in the 1970s I recall debates on whether Chase Farm should be closed There are agendas colleagues will recognise such agendas all over the country that live on beyond past directors trusts and reconfigurations somebody always has an aspiration to close something and centralise something else If hon Members think politics in the House of Commons is robust they should try NHS politics which is far more robust and nastier than anything we experience here I congratulate my hon Friend the Member for Ealing Southall Mr Sharma on opening and securing this debate and on the campaign he is running on behalf of the people of his constituency Many Members are involved in that campaign in west London and the one in south London What is going on in London is outrageous I ask the House to consider what my right hon Friend the Member for Tottenham Mr Lammy said London has a fast growing population great health inequalities and poverty and a fast growing number of people in the daytime the population of central London goes up phenomenally during the day because of people commuting to work going to cultural or sporting events or simply passing through the capital city If we start closing A and E departments and saying that everything should go out into the community and thus that hospitals can be reduced and closed we are making the future very dangerous for our communities As the House is well aware I represent Islington North The Whittington hospital is in my constituency Anything I say about the hospital is not a criticism of it or its wonderful staff I absolutely support them and their work Some three years ago we discovered that the A and E department was due to be closed As ever there were denials all over the place I tell the hon Member for Morecambe and Lunesdale David Morris to be ever so sceptical when told that an A and E department is not closing because closure is closing in a plan somewhere We exposed the plan to close the Whittington A and E and eventually had the most bizarre general election rally ever in 2010 when the right hon Member for South Cambridgeshire Mr Lansley the hon Members for North Norfolk Norman Lamb and for Hornsey and Wood Green Lynne Featherstone my right hon Friends the Members for Holborn and St Pancras Frank Dobson and for Tottenham and my hon Friend the Member for Islington South and Finsbury Emily Thornberry and I were on a platform pledging to save the A and E department which was duly saved However time moves on The hospital wants to become a trust and has begun putting together a financial package to which my right hon Friend the Member for Tottenham referred The package involves the sale of a quarter of the site apparently 17 million is to be made from that the loss of 500 jobs and a reduction of the number of beds in the hospital to 177 which is about half what it was five years ago We asked whether an A and E department with a hospital of only 177 beds behind it was viable Is that not a plan to remove the Whittington as an overall local district general hospital with an A and E department in future The Camden New Journal and Islington Tribune reported on this with great alacrity last week I congratulate Tom Foot and all those who put the story together because I suspect the issue would not otherwise have reached the light of day At a public meeting next Tuesday friends neighbouring MPs and many others from the local community will be questioning the chief executive and others from the hospital and taking part in a big campaign to protect our hospital We all face issues of health care I think there is a consensus that we all respect and value the principles of the national health service but if we allow buildings to be sold off and A and E departments to close we will end up with the health service becoming a service of last resort and with the promotion of private medicine at the expense of the NHS We will end up with much poorer societies and much greater health inequalities and that is in nobody s interest Let us get control of this in a democratic way so that we can control what goes on in the health service in our name

No I will not give way The right hon Lady had her opportunity in government so I will continue When my residents go to their planning committee what they often see sadly is a lack of meaningful engagement They are squeezed into a five minute deputation to have their voice heard The process is often based around the negative about what people can try to keep hold of for their community rather than on engaging people from the beginning in shaping communities as part of a neighbourhood plan Yes there may be those with sharp elbows but we are increasingly seeing those who are dispossessed but who want a louder voice Let me quote Mark Eaton of the BBC who is not always a supporter of the Government He said that this Bill may well amount to the biggest change to grass roots politics in England since universal suffrage He recognises as do others that the Bill gives real power back to communities and it is based on pounds shillings and pence For example the community infrastructure levy will provide an opportunity properly to ensure that money is in the hands of local communities so that they can make and shape their areas It is about empowering communities whether it be in the most important power of competence in the community right to buy or in the neighbourhood plan Whether they are referred to as Easy councils or John Lewis councils diversity in provision will be important It will be important to look at the details of the Bill such as those relating to business involvement Questions can be asked about where the businesses are in the neighbourhood plan One need only look at the local growth White Paper which recognises that every local authority will be able to put in the foundations for local economic growth As I see in my high streets the lifeblood of my Enfield community businesses will have a crucial role to play It is important to allow communities to be able to question for example the prospect of an A and E closure such as at Chase Farm opening up the decision to the community by way of a referendum Greater transparency is important at last Transport for London will have a degree of transparency matched by that of local communities That is what is needed for our communities We need to be bold we need to ensure innovation efficiency and diversity We also need to recognise and give three cheers to local activists whether they be sharp elbowed or not These are people who for too long have been shut out from decisions in the community and decisions in local authorities They should be able to help to challenge and shape their communities We have often referred to the need to shout out Power to the people At long last we can ensure that we deliver that rallying cry through the Bill

I thank the Secretary of State for her answer Christmas is meant to be the season of good will but for a second consecutive year in Northern Ireland there is a real risk that it will be a season of entrenched mistrust and political failure The people of Northern Ireland want progress They yearn for politicians who offer hope that the journey to a shared future while not easy is irreversible and who accept that a shared obligation and a shared commitment to a better future require compromise and mutual respect Of course the UK and Irish Governments have responsibilities too Three years of relative disengagement by the UK Government have damaged trust and weakened mutual understanding It also has to be recognised that Northern Ireland faces unique challenges related to the past A properly resourced comprehensive framework should be part of any agreement but fairness also means that there can be no blank cheques or exemption from tough choices Northern Ireland has the right not to implement aspects of Tory Lib Dem welfare cuts but a refusal to implement any welfare reform is neither affordable nor credible I have some questions for the Secretary of State Will she spell out how the 1 billion of extra spending power offered by the Prime Minister is broken down Where is the money going to come from How quickly will the loan element have to be repaid and at what rate of interest What is the Government s estimate of the overall annual cost to Northern Ireland s budget of the current instruments to deal with the past and of those envisaged under new arrangements Finally Prime Ministers usually attend political negotiations either to announce an agreement or to roll their sleeves up and stick around to make an agreement possible As the Prime Minister did neither can the Secretary of State explain the strategy underpinning his flying visit to Belfast last week Does she expect him to engage further in the talks before Christmas

It is a great pleasure to follow the hon Member for Barnsley Central Dan Jarvis I speak both as a local Member of Parliament and as chairman of the all party groups on heritage rail the link will become clear in a moment and on democratic participation This debate is being watched in the House and outside by those with an active involvement in the NCS and they might think Why isn t there a packed House to celebrate such an important scheme However they should draw some comfort from the fact that that means it is not a contentious scheme but one that has cross party support All right hon and hon Members want it to succeed It is in a way a good sign that while there is not that much interest there is not too much controversy about this Bill I welcome the fact that the Bill will place the NCS on a statutory footing and bring it close to being a national institution and a rite of passage for 15 to 17 year olds I want to join others in paying tribute to the former Prime Minister and Member for Witney David Cameron who was a great champion of NCS and to my hon Friend the Member for Ruislip Northwood and Pinner Mr Hurd who is now a Minister in another Department but who did so much to get NCS up and running in the last Parliament I pay tribute to those working on NCS at a national level and to those who as we have heard participate as volunteers and mentors in all the schemes Without their great dedication the schemes would not have been so successful Finally I pay tribute to the current Minister and Secretary of State for championing NCS It would be fair to say that my family and that of the Secretary of State already know the benefits of outdoor activity because we often take them on route marches in the summer recesses I wish to deal with three issues today the building of skills that our young people need for life in 21st century Britain the community cohesion and integration aspects of NCS and the specific amendment tabled in the other place which I also intend to put down on volunteering for what is considered to be an industrial undertaking The NCS is often the first step for young people on their youth social action journey and it places emphasis on creating more integrated and engaged citizens The Prime Minister s recent speech unveiling the shared society has already been mentioned She rightly said that it is time to tackle the culture of individualism that seems to have grown up The NCS is about ensuring that young people are equipped with the necessary skills to get ahead in life I was pleased to hear the hon Member for Dagenham and Rainham Jon Cruddas talking about character because I championed character education when I was running the Department for Education and I set up the character awards and grants I have had conversations with both local and national providers and I believe that NCS will play a hugely important part in building the individual and national character of young people The NCS is a vital extracurricular activity but is also about civic engagement Recent research shows that participants in the NCS are more likely to vote Bite the Ballot partners with the NCS via the Challenge Network from 2014 has provided the tools used to run sessions on political engagement As a result 95 of all participants have gone on to register to vote At a time when we often lament the fact that young people are not much engaged in the political process that just shows one of the benefits of NCS Through NCS programmes young people are able to work with local businesses and social leaders to develop their resilience grit one of my favourite words teamwork and leadership skills and to discover more about their area through delivering local volunteering projects that matter to them I recently met Education Business Partnership the regional delivery partner of the NCS in my own constituency which has worked with more than 5 000 16 and 17 year olds in the east midlands since 2011 It has been supported to carry out over 100 000 hours of social action In Loughborough I have worked with a number of organisations that benefit from NCS social action including Rainbows children s hospice and the Falcon centre which provides homeless people with accommodation I suspect that all hon Members in their places today in common with my right hon Friend the Member for Saffron Walden Sir Alan Haselhurst will have met local NCS cohorts I have met at least three of mine during their residential week in Leicester at the end of their social action project to renovate the community room at Hind Leys College and the project at Fearon Hall in my constituency The last one involved the great sacrifice of eating cupcakes on a Saturday morning It was very difficult and I was delighted that they had chosen to raise funds in that way There is an intensive nature to and seriousness behind the NCS programme Hon Members have already spoken about the levelling effects of the activities and the setting of shared goals that contributes to the development of a common identity between the participants who often come from diverse backgrounds People have been right to speak about the national importance of NCS The result of last year s referendum has meant that discussions about national identity are ever more to the fore and I believe that the mixing of people from different backgrounds is a vital part of what NCS offers I also welcome the fact that the Bill will encourage more young people to take advantage of the programme Schools are clearly an important way of reaching young people and informing them of the benefits of participating in the programme When I was Secretary of State for Education I had some conversations with the Minister I was very much of the view that schools should facilitate the giving of information to young people about the benefits of the scheme It is sometimes tempting to ask our schools to do an awful lot but I used to say that if we asked schools to do everything that other people asked of them they would never get round to teaching until about midnight every night We must have a balance but there must be a way for schools to facilitate the giving of information about the programme both to future participants and to parents and families and to allow those who have participated in the scheme to come back and talk to future cohorts about why they should sign up I hope to pick up an amendment that was tabled in the other place and I hope that we may be able at least to debate it The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the Bill does not unintentionally prevent young people from working as volunteers on a heritage railway or tramway as part of a programme provided or arranged by the NCS A similar amendment was tabled by Lord Faulkner and has already been debated in the other place As I have said I am the chair of the all party parliamentary group on heritage rail and I recognise the considerable contribution that that sector makes to local economies through tourism and employment Indeed the Great Central Railway which is in my constituency attracts 138 000 visitors per year In 2015 the value of tourism to Leicestershire grew for the sixth consecutive year reaching a record high of 1 57 billion and providing employment for more than 20 700 people Young people will be vital to the success of the industry as they provide voluntary maintenance and operational support In turn heritage railways and tramways help to engage young people and provide a platform for them to learn the important new skills that the NCS is instilling However it appears that the Employment of Women Young Persons and Children Act 1920 excludes children defined in section 558 of the Education Act 1996 as an individual who has not yet reached 16 from working in what is described as an industrial undertaking It seems therefore that it is illegal for young people to volunteer on heritage railways although the current push towards volunteering did not exist when the 1920 Act came into force A new clause has been proposed to clarify the Bill and to make it clear that that Act should not prevent young people from volunteering on heritage railways and tramways Health and safety have been discussed this afternoon I should emphasise that the standard health and safety safeguarding and supervisory requirements would of course still apply We need more young volunteers on our heritage railways and the all party parliamentary group will be considering the role of apprenticeships and the development of employability skills that are vital in the 21st century Let me end by expressing my wholehearted support for the NCS and the Bill and my wish to see maximum participation in the NCS in the future It is a good thing in fact a great thing for the individual young people who participate but it is also a great thing for this country I hope to have an opportunity to ask Ministers to think about updating the law in respect of heritage railways and industrial undertakings

Following the point made by my hon Friend the Member for Reading East Mr Wilson I should say that the people of Suffolk had the temerity not to return a suitable number of Conservative Members of Parliament in previous elections and therefore were right at the back of the queue for Building Schools for the Future They were kept waiting under this inadequate system Can the Secretary of State confirm when the people of Chantry high school and Stoke high school who have been kept waiting for many years might expect some sort of investment I am thinking also of Holywells school which is part of the national challenge scheme

I was about to come to that So far the Lisbon agenda has not received the strength of support and implementation that is required As I have said in the House on many occasions we must do much more to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon agenda The position of France and Germany has already been mentioned in the course of the debate and as I have said I believe that these are difficulties primarily of a structural kind But we must be careful about offering ourselves as some paradigm of economic virtue and seek not in some condescending way to suggest to other countries in the European Union that we have found the perfect way forward The hon Gentleman mentioned the Lisbon agenda We should certainly seek to encourage productivity enhance labour market flexibility and create a genuine free market in goods persons capital and as has been observed services And we should seek to deregulate wherever possible of that there is no doubt But we should also have a rigorous approach here in London because very often the argument is not that the original regulation from Brussels was particularly difficult or austere in its terms but that by the time it had been through the machinery of government here it had become gold plated to the point where something that sought to create a common standard across the European Union was being implemented much more rigorously here in the United Kingdom to the detriment of those whose businesses were affected by it I want to claim that the recent round of enlargement has been an enormous success The ability to spread stability democracy and economic opportunity to a wider region of Europe has been a tremendous thing for the continent I hope that the demise of the constitution will not put an end to the accession negotiations with Turkey or derail membership talks with other Balkan states such as Croatia I hope too that we shall promote the forthcoming accession of Romania and Bulgaria with enthusiasm provided of course that they meet the Copenhagen criteria in full But without doubt in the changed circumstances since the referendums in Holland and France we must look again at the engagement of the people of Europe with the European Union We need to start here first not lecturing others but re engaging the interest and awareness of the British people by ensuring that European issues are more frequently and more publicly brought into the national political debate I do not think that any of us can be satisfied with the way in which we scrutinise European legislation in this place and I do not exempt myself or my party from that criticism We should find methods of ensuring that national Parliaments have a much greater role in the European legislative process and devote much more of their time to consideration of European legislative proposals That is much more likely to stimulate active and wide ranging political debate at a domestic level and bring about the sort of debate that the hon Member for Woodspring was arguing for a little while ago I see that as an obligation not just upon Government but upon Members of Parliament

I am disappointed that it is not the Secretary of State at the Dispatch Box Labour s NHS plan states that the Government are in favour of a new pay system for the NHS and figures published today detail the pay received by the service s humble and self effacing nurses They show that general nurses get about two thirds of what is paid for agency work while a theatre registered general nurse gets paid about half the rate for an agency job Is it the Government s plan to bring the pay of people who work for the national health service up to the levels available outside so that they will not leave the service and work elsewhere If so will he ensure that all those working for the NHS come within the pay review body structure Above all will he ensure that ambulance personnel receive the sort of pay that people who save lives every day deserve

I thank the right hon Gentleman for his question The Government will always take a look at the evidence In fact we debated APD in the House only the week before last In October 2012 Her Majesty s Revenue and Customs published modelling on price differentials at UK airports and it showed that even large price changes have a relatively small impact on total passenger demand but I am sure he will welcome my right hon Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer s announcement of the 800 million investment in Airport City in Manchester which will create over 16 000 jobs The involvement of Beijing Construction Engineering Group as a partner in this project is the latest in a line of new partnerships being forged between the UK and China

Where local authorities wish to impose workplace parking levies they need the Secretary of State s approval under current legislation It is of course up to local authorities to promote such schemes if they feel that they are appropriate for their areas but I have said recently that I would expect any further schemes proposed to me to demonstrate that they have properly and effectively consulted local businesses and addressed any proper concerns raised by local businesses during those consultations So perhaps my hon Friend can feed that back to Bristol city council

Has the Secretary of State had a chance to review the comments made last week by the German Defence Minister Mr Franz Josef Jung in which he criticised the British policy of holding talks with supporters of the Taliban in Musa Qala When the Secretary of State meets Mr Jung at the NATO conference will he point out that if Germany had its troops on the front line in Helmand rather than in the relatively peaceful north he would appreciate just as British military commanders do that this strategy of engagement is essential if we are to have any long term hope of resolving the conflict

I welcome the Prime Minister s recognition of the progress made in the north east economy In the economic context it is said that when the United States sneezes the United Kingdom catches cold and the north east of England gets pneumonia I was therefore sad to learn at the weekend that the regional development agency One NorthEast is preparing budgets within year for 40 cuts in operational output Does the Prime Minister think that is good medicine for that sort of pneumonia

We are not going to take lectures from Conservative Members on this subject given that they presided over the loss of 50 000 teaching posts between 1979 and 1997 He is right to say that we have significant numbers of teachers from overseas but they are not unqualified they are qualified in their own countries Some 4 200 teachers are on employment based training routes In fact the majority of teachers in schools today are now qualified many have qualified since January Part of the reason why so many teachers are on schemes such as the graduate teacher programme is that we are dealing with teacher shortages by providing other routes for people to get into teaching I am sure that the hon Gentleman would want to welcome that

It is a fortunate council but the vast majority of councils have had to move from that system We wish to enable those authorities that want to retain such a system to continue with the alternative arrangements for as long as they wish That is contrary to the determination of Government they would sooner or later close down that option The hon Member for Leicester South Sir Peter Soulsby was particularly forthright in his contributions in Committee For example he said I do indeed recall the strengths of that system as well as its weaknesses I am convinced that those strengths can be used to produce a reformed committee structure and a system that would enable the leadership and accountability that we have all said we would wish local government to deliver He is right Committee members of different parties expressed the same sense We could not quite understand why the Government were so adamant about closing down the option of a revised committee system In the spirit of the debates that we have had I urge the Minister to think again when this Bill passes to another place and to listen to councillors who say that the change from the committee system has disfranchised a number of back bench councillors who want more to their role than just scrutiny They want to deliver more Councillor Phyllis Gershon of Bedfordshire county council I am delighted to have had the chance to mention Bedfordshire as it has not been included in the place naming during the course of the evening has persistently told me that councils need that option It should not be forced on them but it should be an option for them I ask the Minister why be so prescriptive My third and last point relates to elected executives The Government will not allow councils the option of a revised modernised committee system which many councillors have mentioned including the council leaders who came to brief the Committee Members of the Committee have also spoken about it However the Government are prepared to press heavily for elected executives although we cannot see any evidence that anyone wants them We pressed the Minister on that in Committee where are the examples of the public or the local government fraternity clamouring for the opportunity to deliver elected executives The Minister was not able to enlighten us I therefore humbly suggest that local authorities will not pick up on that option I cannot see why he should be so keen on that option but not on a modernised committee system Several of our amendments deal with an elected executive and had there been more time we would probably have pressed an amendment on throwing out the elected executive option Instead we will probably press to a vote the general amendment on clause 34 that I mentioned earlier Those are my three points local freedom is being denied the committee model is not provided as an option and elected executives are being given the thumbs up by Government when nobody seems to want them In the spirit of the Bill which is supposed to be about a listening Government we have given the Government an opportunity not to be prescriptive They have not taken similar chances in the past and that has marred the Bill but this is an opportunity for a champagne moment The Minister could say We have listened to you you ve got it right and we ll give it up

As I have said some of them have gone on for years Some cases are still sitting in courts overseas It is predominantly a matter of months and years at present and we want to reduce that to days and weeks Every day on which we cannot access content in this area and let us remember that it is the court not me that must be satisfied that a request from the police is valid is a day on which in many cases the offenders are still offending That is why we think the Bill is so important It reflects the changes in how offending is happening and the fact that it is now happening online For many months Members on both sides of the House have asked what more the Government can do about not only online radicalisation but online offending This is a concrete step to ensure that we can do more to counter it The MLA process will continue to exist It remains critical to other types of evidence that are not within the scope of the Bill and to any electronic evidence that may not be provided for by the relevant international agreement However one of the biggest pitfalls of the current system is the long wait to secure electronic data that by its nature can be shared very quickly The Bill provides the solution in the form of an additional streamlined alternative the overseas production order I do not doubt that Members will support the crucial purpose of the Bill which is to provide a significantly faster mechanism for obtaining vital electronic data that is held by overseas providers in order to prosecute the most serious offenders and to safeguard vulnerable people in our society from further unnecessary harm I commend it to the House

We have had a good debate 26 colleagues right hon and hon Members have spoken It is the most enjoyable European debate that I have listened to during the decade or more that I have been a Member of the House Colleagues have responded to one another and taken forward proper dialogue and discussion For the most part there have been no set piece speak your weight pre written speeches The debate is part of my right hon Friend the Foreign Secretary s clear commitment to bring these issues to Parliament Since the intergovernmental conference of October 2003 we have had no fewer than 16 debates 14 of them on the Floor of the House which have dealt wholly or in large part with the EU constitutional treaty There have been a further 13 debates in the House of Lords Commons European Scrutiny Committees and House of Lords European Committees have undertaken detailed inquiries into aspects of the treaty Ministers including myself have given evidence There have been Westminster Hall debates and of course the unprecedented creation of a Standing Committee on the Intergovernmental Conference the only time in parliamentary history when Members have been allowed to question Ministers about the negotiation of a treaty while it was under way We want to maintain that which is why I welcome the part of the new treaty that strengthens the role of national Parliaments It is true that we shall have to adapt our ways of thinking We shall need to talk and communicate with colleagues in other national Parliaments but Labour and other Members will want to use the occasion of the treaty to strengthen parliamentary accountability for what is done in our name in Europe

The Minister has just enticed me to speak for at least another hour he should be very careful about teasing me at the Dispatch Box We have to accept that horrendously tens of thousands of civilians were killed in the two world wars by direct munitions We can think of the 30 000 French casualties during the liberation of Normandy or the tens of thousands of British and German civilians who were killed in area bombing many of them by land mines that were left behind My hon Friend the Member for Bournemouth East Mr Ellwood said that those who drop or lay mines should effectively be responsible for clearing up but that has not applied in the case of either the British or German Government In fact it is the home Government who have to do it The only contribution that we have made to the continuing business of collecting munitions dropped by Bomber Command during the second world war has been to provide thank goodness an amazing array of aerial photographs The casualty element of the problem which my hon Friend the Member for Salisbury Robert Key so movingly brought to bear on the debate shows the legacy of these weapons It is sometimes difficult for us to think about the tens of thousands of people affected in Cambodia Afghanistan and elsewhere they are numbers despite the photographs and so on The legacy of the weapons in question still exists and there are still casualties in Belgium and northern France from munitions from the two world wars An old friend of mine was killed 11 years ago He was a military historian at Sandhurst who foolishly brought back a piece of unexploded munitions from the battlefield in France quite illegally It was placed on his study desk and one evening he was working the heat in the room changed and the thing blew up and killed him He is not alone There is therefore a historical element to such casualties My next point is important I do not believe that my hon Friends made it to undermine the purpose of the Bill which they all said that they support However several colleagues asked why the UK Government changed their mind about the decision to do without cluster munitions It might be helpful to the debate in Committee if the Minister provided an aide mémoire from the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence outlining the reasons for the decision My shorthand on the matter is that the Ministry of Defence was always loathe to give up that range of munitions partly because it was still thinking in cold war terms but also because it believed that there was always a possibility of finding ourselves in a conflict in which we might need such munitions It is a fair and legitimate question for colleagues to ask I urge the Minister to ask the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Defence to provide if possible an aide mémoire I imagine that it is possible because the information cannot be restricted certainly not nowadays or it would automatically end up in The Independent or The Times An aide mémoire should be produced in time for Committee stage I am sure that that will find support from hon Members of all parties My hon Friend the Member for Aylesbury Mr Lidington asked a series of questions The first an important question was what changed the Government s mind He like other colleagues rightly made the point that many of our allies still see the utility of possessing the munitions I will not regurgitate the arguments of particularly my hon Friends about how we operate in coalitions when some of our partners still possess and maintain the right to use such weapons under certain circumstances I do not think that that is legal nit picking there is potentially a genuine problem My hon Friend the Member for Aylesbury the hon Member for East Dunbartonshire Jo Swinson and others asked about the indirect financing of cluster munitions and where that fits in the Bill My hon Friend s final point was that there is no explicit commitment by the UK Government to meet the eight year deadline in the Bill The Minister is doing a cute frown at me and fluttering his eyelids in a way that only the Government Whips Office normally sees

I believe so There has been a change in attitude from the EU and the Office Internationale d Epizootic Indeed the right hon Member for Skipton and Ripon and my hon Friend the Member for Carlisle joined me at the conference in Brussels that was co sponsored by the UK and Holland to look at the whole issue of foot and mouth disease The experience that we had in the last outbreak has changed the thinking in all countries it has also changed the thinking in relation to the international organisation and the European Union Incidentally that change makes the vaccination options easier it addresses some of the issues and problems that we came across in the course of the last epidemic I hope that I have demonstrated that the Government have responded to the thrust of the arguments in terms of the role of vaccination that the Lords amendment is flawed and that we cannot accept it I call on the House to support the Government

No I am not going to give way again Amendment 47 tabled by the Chair of the Exiting the European Union Committee is slightly different in that it would make the use of clause 9 dependent on approval of the withdrawal agreement by both Houses without specifying statute Similar timing concerns apply We would need to retain the option to ready statutory instruments before such approval but I have made clear and I make clear again that they would not enter into force until Parliament had held its meaningful vote New clause 68 replicates the provisions of amendment 47 with the addition that the Government must seek the approval of Parliament no later than three months before the date of exit We cannot bind ourselves to such strict sequencing constraints when the latter stages of the negotiations remain unknown To do so in fact would be irresponsible It is also a vague and arguably defective new clause I say with the greatest respect because it is not clear whether by the conclusion of the agreement the hon Member for Swansea West Geraint Davies means finalisation of the text signature ratification or entry into force For those reasons I hope hon Members will not press their new clauses and amendments

My hon Friend makes an important point about the teachers pension scheme The employer contribution rate will increase from 16 to 23 in September 2019 but as confirmed earlier in April we will be providing funding for this increase in 2019 20 for all state funded schools further education and sixth form colleges and adult community learning providers My hon Friend the Member for Saffron Walden Mrs Badenoch asked about that funding in future years and it will of course be a matter for the spending review The hon Member for Enfield Southgate Bambos Charalambous asked whether I could meet his local headteachers to discuss funding and I would be delighted to do so The Secretary of State and I meet headteachers regularly almost on a weekly basis to discuss not only school funding but other issues such as standards in our schools and we would be happy to do that with the hon Gentleman s local headteachers as well Standards are rising in our schools Thanks in part to our reforms the proportion of pupils in good or outstanding schools has increased from 66 in 2010 to 85 I listened carefully to the excellent opening speech by my hon Friend the Member for St Albans who has raised the issue of school funding both for her constituency s schools and nationally on many occasions including in Westminster Hall debates recently and again today I am sure that the Treasury will also have heard what she had to say today I can give her the assurances she seeks that the Secretary of State and I are both working hard to prepare our spending review bid for when that process starts later in the year to ensure that we have the best bid possible for schools high needs and post 16 funding As I was saying standards are rising in our schools In primary schools our more rigorous curriculum is on a par with the highest performing in the world and it has been taught since September 2014 Since it was first tested in 2016 we have seen the proportion of primary school pupils reaching the expected standard in the maths test rise from 70 to 76 in 2018 and in the reading test the figure has risen from 66 to 75 Of course we would not know that if we adopted the Labour party s policy of scrapping SATs which of course we will not do

I thank my hon Friend for his generous comments Through him I pay tribute to the good people of Knowsley who have led the way in this area down the years The Minister for Care Services was in Knowsley just last week looking at the fantastic work done by health and social care staff in integrating services They genuinely I know we say this a lot but in this case I mean it offer a model for others to follow I am happy to endorse what my hon Friend the Member for Knowsley South Mr O Hara says without investment in the staff we do not have the basis of a national care service We can learn from how we have offered a better career progression for staff in the national health service and transfer some of those principles to improving the social care work force That is not to say that today we do not respect what they do we do but I do not believe they get the recognition for what they provide in all our communities and to all our families

Certainly scales fell from my eyes several times when previous local government Ministers spoke The hon Member for Mole Valley Sir Paul Beresford and the right hon Members for North West Hampshire Sir George Young and for Skipton and Ripon Mr Curry gave tremendous reasons for doing all sorts of things at the time Now they come along and say that we are not doing enough to repeal measures that they introduced I want to deal with clauses 77 and 78 which deal with the extremely important matters of property revaluation and council tax banding Revaluation is essential nobody can be in any doubt that since 1991 there have been huge changes in property values not just nationally but within and between regions so we must make sure that that is reflected in council tax bands There is an extensive home ownership market in this country and house values represent closely people s ability to pay for housing If they can do so they can pay for their council tax as well A council tax band that does not accurately reflect the real value of a house will in the long term bring banding into disrepute

We have not made a final decision about the demands that we make to Russia It is clear that Russia has co operated well particularly recently in arriving at agreed positions in respect of Iran after many months of abstaining on resolutions in the board of governors At the crucial board of governors meeting on 4 February Russia and China voted to report the matter to the Security Council They also supported the presidency s statement in the Security Council on 29 March If we are to continue with effective pressure on Iran we must have Russia and China with us but it must be tough pressure as well So far we are achieving that

That is a very good question The initial challenge posed by the new psychoactive substances otherwise known as legal highs was that there was no test that could detect them It was therefore very easy for people not only to get them into prison but to make them up from a number of components We now have a test that can identify the drugs so we have introduced mandatory drug testing but we are also going further to tackle the criminality that drives the smuggling of the drugs into prisons We will invest 3 million in a new prison wide intelligence and search capability that will allow us not only to gather intelligence across the system about which criminal gangs are behind the drugs and trying to get them into our prisons but to stop them Tackling the use of mobile phones is also vital because while some prisoners want access to them in order to contact friends and family a vast number of prisoners use them for criminal purposes including arranging a time for drugs to come in and telling someone where to send the drone Dealing with the illicit smuggling of mobile phones into our prisons is absolutely key Like drones it is a technological problem and I believe that technology is the way to deal with it That is why we are working with the mobile network operators to find a way to prevent mobile phones from working in our prisons and with drone manufacturers to create no fly zones across our prison estate My hon Friend specifically mentioned violence against staff Alongside measures on drones drugs and phones it is essential that we increase staff confidence in the prison system That starts with achieving swift justice when assaults occur My hon Friend and I share that concern We are rolling out body worn cameras across the estate in order to give staff added confidence while also supporting bringing timely and effective trials for prisoners when necessary We will work with other parts of the criminal justice system including the National Crime Agency and the police to improve the evidence collection process to ensure a right first time culture By clamping down on staff assaults we will help break the vicious cycle of violence committed by some of our most challenging prisoners My hon Friend mentioned the retirement age of prison officers which ties into yesterday s action The Government are actively engaged with the Prison Officers Association in negotiations around pay pensions the retirement age retention and health and safety That is why we were surprised by the action of the POA yesterday We have an outstanding offer to the POA as of last Friday and the POA is yet to respond to it I believe that by coming back to the negotiating table we will be able to discuss these issues to secure the safety of officers and to ensure that the jobs in their profession are as well rewarded as they obviously should be The Secretary of State and I have made it clear over recent weeks that we are taking decisive and urgent action to improve prison safety The safety and security measures in our White Paper will work alongside key measures such as the 1 3 billion that we are investing to regenerate the old Victorian estate and reforms to empower prison governors We have a genuine commitment to alleviating violence against our staff which we cannot ignore in the current context My hon Friend mentioned prison management and I believe that our reform programme will really help in that context by empowering governors and giving them control over their budgets That will enable them to make decisions about the employment education and training of prisoners It will also enable them to deploy staff in a way that best allows them to deliver a prison regime that not only provides safety and security but turns prisoners around Prison governors will be real managers and leaders of their shop At the moment too much comes from Whitehall We want to give prison governors responsibility and freedom with obviously the right accountability framework With that we will see the change in management culture that my hon Friend pointed to My hon Friend mentioned the prison population which comes up in numerous debates Prison has to be the last resort for anyone who has committed a crime Our job is to make sure that where people have committed an offence and are sentenced there is capacity in the system for our prisons to deliver on the orders of the court I do not believe that the way to deal with the prison population issue is to let prisoners out arbitrarily especially considering the impact that that would have on victims and families I believe that the best way to deal with the population in the long term is to cut reoffending By reducing reoffending we will reduce the prison population I hope that my hon Friend is reassured that the Government are pressing forward with these measures at great speed and intensity because like him we value the admirable work that our prison officers do We want them to benefit from the improvements we are making both on the frontline and to safety and security which will ultimately help them to change prisoners lives for the better Prison safety is an integral part of the health of the system in which prison officers operate As I have said we encourage the POA to come back to the negotiating table so that we can work together to tackle the safety challenges that concern us all Question put and agreed to House adjourned

This is clearly an important debate as evidenced by the testimonies that many Members have from their constituencies about RBS GRG But it goes far wider than that because RBS was not alone in facing allegations of mis selling of treating companies badly at the height of the banking crisis and of poor redress since I am sure that many Members will have had cases of Clydesdale s tailored business loan mis selling where redress has not yet been made and constituents may have lost their homes businesses and livelihoods as a result It is also the case this adds to our frustrations and those of our constituents that some products were regulated and others were not and that some customers were deemed to be sophisticated investors while others were not In short there was an opaque regulatory environment that may have been sufficient in the good times but most certainly was not when the money ran out and the banks were at their most stressed All the banks came under scrutiny but much of the focus understandably was on RBS because it had such a large market share because by some measures it was the largest bank in the world and not least because of the allegations surrounding the treatment of businesses after they entered the bank s GRG I will not describe the genesis of the products that people bought as the hon Member for Norwich South Clive Lewis did that well I simply say that when businesses wished to extract themselves sometimes their only way of escape was to pay substantial sums larger than any capital ever borrowed but as they were distressed themselves as the economy downturned that was not possible and so in the case of RBS they went to GRG One would have thought as many have said that this was to help businesses to recover but few did To be fair some of those businesses are likely to have failed anyway while others were potentially viable and referral to GRG may have caused some difficulties But the key point is that some definitely experienced actions that were likely to have resulted in material financial distress One of the many reasons this was able to happen is that in some cases commercial lending was not regulated To be fair to RBS it did work with the FCA and it has implemented the complaints review It also trained the team under Sir William Blackburne who was honest in saying that outcomes were not being delivered quickly However all that remedial work some of which was very good is undermined by the swirling belief that refuses to go away that businesses referred to GRG were cash poor but asset rich and artificial default events were engineered In short the businesses were asset stripped These allegations are made all the more persuasive by the fact that as we now know GRG had a commercial objective and was part of project dash for cash and by what we have seen since the Treasury Committee published the Just Hit Budget memo and the memo from 2008 09 I fully support the motion I want to end because time is short The memo from RBS GRG said that a customer should transfer to GRG if a significant deterioration in any aspect of their activity had happened where a breach of covenant was likely but had not happened or where they may miss a contractual payment to anyone So even businesses that stuck to the terms of the RBS agreement could be referred to GRG That was completely wrong

In that vote we simply recognised what we understand as the constitutional position which the Prime Minister restated last week that the House has ultimate sovereignty However it is not necessary to expand on that further today The Government are again faced with substantial parts of the constitution which they privately but forlornly hoped would go away if they said nothing about it The German presidency s approach was spelled out in the questionnaire that it sent to European capitals a few weeks ago It referred to preserving the substance of the constitution while making the necessary presentational changes Such an approach is a profound mistake I think that the Foreign Secretary believes that it is a mistake As the Laeken declaration in December 2001 recognised the crucial question is how the EU can be brought closer to its peoples There can be no surer way of worsening the democratic deficit and disconnection between EU institutions and peoples than ignoring the verdict of the voters There are those who say that the EU is a project pushed forward by a political elite who do not care what ordinary people want because they think they know better so what better way to confirm that argument than by saying that if the people democratically reject the EU constitution we will just bring it back with a few presentational tweaks If people do not feel ownership over the EU they will steadily turn against it which would not be in Britain s or Europe s interest Further political integration must have the people s permission In our view political integration has already gone too far Either way however it should be for the British people to decide The Prime Minister appeared to recognise that when he agreed that there should be a referendum on the EU constitution He famously discovered his reverse gear we all watched him doing it in the House in April 2004 by saying Let battle be joined With the zeal of a convert he gave cast iron assurances that the British people would have their say During the general election campaign he told The Sun We don t know what is going to happen in France but we will have a referendum on the constitution in any event and that he told The Sun was a Government promise He went even further by saying What you can t do is have a situation where you get a rejection of the treaty and then you just bring it back with a few amendments and say we will have another go The Government have absolutely no democratic mandate to bring in parts of the constitution without a referendum of the British people That is why if there is a new treaty that transfers competences from Britain to the EU by bringing back parts of the constitution we are clear that there must be referendum That must apply whether the transfer of competence is handed over on day one of the new treaty or whether a ratchet effect is initiated that will see power shift to the EU as decisions and judgments are made over the years

Today we saw the ceremony for confirming the move of the EU anti piracy taskforce from Northwood to a new location near Cadiz All around us we are hearing about the consequences of Brexit not only on the defence industry but on our security relationships Despite there being a rather uncommon consensus in the House about the importance of those relationships we have heard precious little from the Department Not only our closest allies but the defence industry serving personnel and policy makers need clarity on the UK s grand strategy Will the Minister stop hedging their bets and tell us about the defence and security relationship that the Government want with the EU

I agree I thank my hon Friend for making the point that this is not just about cancer treatment but about a wide range of surgical treatments and therapies for any number of conditions If the Bill is about reducing medical litigation so that doctors are free to undertake innovative treatments why do those who are involved in medical litigation say that there is no need for it The Medical Defence Union the Medical Protection Society even the NHS Litigation Authority are clear that the law with the Bolam and Bolitho tests is well established They feel that the Bill could increase uncertainty The MPS briefing says Fundamentally current law allows doctors acting responsibly to innovate and this Bill is unnecessary The time has come for the debate to shift towards improving education about the present law rather than confusing the law through a new piece of legislation That is another point that is worth bearing in mind Far from promoting medical innovation the Bill could undermine recruitment to genuine clinical trials If someone had been persuaded by the likes of the doctors in the letter that I read out that there was a miraculous treatment for their terminal cancer why would they wish to be enrolled in a clinical trial and be part of a randomised trial If they could circumvent that and go along to a private clinic why would they do that Medical research does not just answer the question about whether a treatment works it also helps answer the question whether a therapy or procedure has serious side effects The history of medicine is littered with good intentions and innovations that seemed like a good idea but turned out to have disastrous side effects I think for example of the use of 100 oxygen for premature babies which led to blindness or the use of steroids after head injury which might have seemed like a good idea at the time but led to many many deaths until it was realised that it was a dangerous innovation There is an assumption that all innovation must be good innovation but much innovation can be dangerous The randomised double blind trial has been one of the greatest advances in medical science and has provided enormous protection for people I look back at my time in medicine Fairly soon after I qualified in 1986 I was a junior doctor on the Hedley Atkins breast unit The newly appointed consultant is now Professor Sir Mike Richards who is one of the country s foremost and respected experts in cancer formerly the cancer czar He does not think the Bill will protect patients We need to listen to the opinion of those who have serious concerns about such Bills When I was working on that cancer unit in the 1980s very many of the patients who did not survive at the time would survive today going to the same unit with similar conditions That is because we now know what the best treatments are We know that not from a series of unlinked anecdotal treatments but because of former patients who were enrolled in clinical trials The accusation sometimes made is Aren t clinical trials just experimenting on people Far from it There seems to be a benefit for everyone taking part in a clinical trial even those who are not receiving a treatment that turns out to be more effective If the Bill is passed and undermines enrolment in clinical trials we will be doing a grave disservice to medical innovation and it will be to our great shame to have done so I would like the Minister to address that point when he responds That is a fundamental flaw in the Bill There is also a fundamental flaw in the premise that separate anecdotal treatments can progress medical research Interestingly clause 1 5 states Nothing in this section permits a doctor to carry out treatment for the purposes of research In other words it specifically precludes the treatments being linked in any way so we will learn nothing from these treatments Lord Saatchi s premise is that his Bill will advance medical knowledge but there is no evidence that it will advance medical knowledge an inch because we will not be able to answer that fundamental question about whether there are unintended harms from the treatments or any long term benefits Where will the evidence be of benefit from those innovative treatments Will the Minister look carefully at that and be clear in responding The list of bodies opposed to the Medical Innovation Bill is very long the Academy for Healthcare Science the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges the Academy of Medical Sciences the Medical Research Council the Wellcome Trust Action Against Medical Accidents the Association of Medical Research Charities the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers the British Medical Association the British Pharmacological Society Cancer Research UK the Good Thinking Society Healthwatch the Medical Protection Society the Medical Defence Union the Motor Neurone Disease Association the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence the NHS Health Research Authority and the NHS Litigation Authority Richard Francis QC one of our most respected national authorities on patient safety opposes the legislation I think that we ought to reflect carefully on his words If there is misunderstanding then it should be corrected by guidance not by legislation which exposes vulnerable patients to unjustified risk and deprives them of remedies when mistreated by those who have no acceptable justification for what they have done Those are very serious words indeed The legislation is also opposed by the Royal College of General Practitioners the Royal College of Physicians the Royal College of Psychiatrists and the Royal College of Radiologists That is an important list There is a powerful lobby in favour of this legislation that purports that those who oppose it are somehow dinosaurs I urge the Minister to read the letter from 100 leading oncologists that was published in The Times on 13 November which states We devote our professional lives to treating patients with cancer and advancing research that contributes to finding more effective treatments for cancer We neither want nor need Lord Saatchi s bill We do not believe that it will help our patients or future patients We are dismayed that the bill is being promoted as offering hope to patients and their families when it will not make any meaningful difference to progress in treating cancer The law of medical negligence does not hinder our work or prevent innovation There have been significant advances across all the modalities of cancer treatment over recent decades There was no call for this change in the law from the medical profession The current law already allows us to use off label drugs and to try new treatments when they are in patients best interests We are concerned that rather than promoting responsible scientific innovation in the treatment of cancer the Medical Innovation Bill will actually encourage irresponsible experimentation producing nothing more than anecdotal evidence at the potential expense of causing serious harm and suffering to patients their families and carers Innovation is best carried out within the discipline of controlled clinical trials not by individual doctors acting on a whim I think that sums it up well Were we to title the Bill correctly it would be called the medical anecdote Bill We should be saying that it makes provision in relation to anecdotal treatments in medical treatment If we titled it correctly there would be no question whatsoever of its having Government support I urge the Minister in the strongest terms please not to give the Bill Government backing To do so I think would be to our great shame We would undoubtedly have to return to amend it It would put patients at risk and it would put recruitment to clinical trials and genuine innovation at risk I look forward to hearing the Minister s response and about the many good things the Government have done to promote genuine innovation I will not detain the House by offering that list now because I know the Minister has done more than anyone I can think of in the House to promote true medical innovation I therefore hope he will recognise that the Bill would do quite the opposite and ensure that it does not progress

Has the hon Gentleman seen the report by the British Academy entitled Drawing a New Constituency Map for the United Kingdom It finds that a number of factors give rise to the apparent bias in the electoral system but that constituency boundaries were worth 18 seats to the Labour party at the last general election He is right to say that there are a number of factors including the distribution of the vote but Labour seats are smaller on average than Conservative seats That independent analysis found that that was worth 18 seats to Labour at the last general election Has he seen that report and would he like to comment on it

I thank the Secretary of State for giving us advance sight of his statement I pay tribute to Martin McGuinness and Ian Paisley for the work they did in advancing devolution That contribution was and remains important Given that the negotiating position seemed to be set in granite at the start of the process it is perhaps little surprise that there has been little movement It appears to have moved from stalemate through deadlock to impasse without ever giving any appearance of compromise Given that the two major parties appear to have enough cold shoulder left over comfortably to see them through the small window of opportunity to which the Secretary of State referred is it time to consider other options There appears to be a presumption against having another election but that would seem to be where the process is headed What preparations is he making for that new election Considering that the election would come in the middle of the early Brexit negotiations what measures is the Secretary of State discussing that will allow Northern Ireland s politicians to play a proper part Has he discussed with the Prime Minister the possibility of delaying the article 50 trigger Given how Scotland has been treated over article 50 I would advise anyone against holding their breath on that In the longer term is it time to revisit the principles of power sharing and look once again at whether the two largest parties should be able to hold the whole legislature in lockdown as they are doing Perhaps it is time to allow Stormont to set its own rules on forming the Executive Finally what consideration is being given to curtailing salary spend on politicians in a legislature that is not sitting

The hon Member for Sunderland South Mr Mullin does a good service to the House in raising his concerns Our view has always been that there was great merit in introducing the principle of bail conditions prior to charge That may be universally welcomed throughout the House Clearly it is desirable because as we discussed on an earlier group of amendments it would allow the police to come to immediate decisions If they can impose bail conditions that secure public protection while they are reconsidering the matter that is a useful tool Against that is the fact that an individual would have restrictions placed on his freedom to behave in a lawful fashion if he wishes without ever having been charged with any offence As usual the House must balance those two factors We are comfortable if I may use the word with the principle of introducing bail prior to charge but we agree with the hon Gentleman that the current position in the Bill which allows that to continue for an indefinite period is gravely unsatisfactory We concur with him that 28 days is a perfectly logical cut off for the matter to be reconsidered So the hon Gentleman has our support We did not table an amendment to the clause on Report because wishing to select what we thought were key areas we were mindful of the fact that another place will have an opportunity to consider these issues with a great deal of legal expertise and experience I would say to the Minister however that I am absolutely convinced that this is an issue which unless the Government reconsider it will not go unchallenged in the other place I know that from consultations and discussions that I have had with my colleagues there who have expressed their concern about this matter I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to give some assurance to the House that the Government will look further at this issue because I cannot logically see why there should not be a 28 day cut off point Equally if the Government wish to come back and say that another period of time would be appropriate they could give us an alternative to consider The cases in which this provision would be likely to be used are plainly not going to be the most serious in terms of public protection issues If there really were a key issue about protecting the public in a particular case it would be a serious matter and the police would doubtless extend the detention period for a long time and try to make it their business to charge whenever possible because they would be concerned about someone being at liberty On the other hand the provision might be used in circumstances in which the police had anxieties about protecting the public or witnesses but simply did not have the necessary evidence That is a compelling reason for putting a finite limit on the period for which these restrictions can apply I hope that we shall receive a positive response from the Minister on this issue My view is that 28 days makes a lot of sense

I have no idea whether they have changed their mind but they have given me an absolute assurance in writing that this provision will be struck out in another place Over the past two and a bit years a great deal of time and energy has been expended in this Chamber on debating these two parallel Bills and indeed the other four that are further back in the pipeline I do not think that further words from me will add anything to the debate My local community in Canterbury is very anxious for this measure which is supported by all parties on Canterbury city council and I would be most grateful for the support of the House

The hon Gentleman deliberately keeps his question as vague as possible He refers to a deployment in the middle east which is a very large region Of course as no theatre missile defence system is readily available to any forces deployed anywhere in that region I can only say that that would not yet be available to the United Kingdom

I certainly agree with the starting point of the right hon and learned Gentleman s question We will put it in the context of a regime where the number of convictions fell by a third where the chances of being a victim of violent crime trebled and of being a victim of burglary more than doubled where crime doubled and where violent crime by the by increased by 168 per cent The Under Secretary of State for the Home Department my hon Friend the Member for Enfield North Joan Ryan made it very clear in last week s Standard that she did not refer the matters in the letter to my right hon Friend the Home Secretary because they were not about the backlog and the 27 500 cases they were about the ACPO contract and the efficacy of that contract since May 2006 In terms of the more general points we will take with a very very strong dose of salt anything said by the right hon and learned Gentleman given his lamentable record

In my remarks I intended no slight to Madeleine Albright I simply meant that the most recent iteration of all this has been led by John Kerry with extraordinary energy and vigour which is why I pay tribute to what he has done As for the second part of the hon Gentleman s question we will of course look at that very closely

I join others in congratulating my hon Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham Daniel Kawczynski on securing this important debate and putting on record his dedication not just to his constituency but to driving the UK s recovery by rebalancing the economy based on export driven recovery He was absolutely right to highlight at the beginning of his speech the importance of the progress made since May 2010 with the refocusing of the Foreign Office on the prosperity agenda and the refocusing of the Department for Business Innovation and Skills on the strategy of pursuing an export led recovery My hon Friend was also right to highlight some of the progress made in exporting expertise particularly in responding to our hon Friend the Member for Ceredigion Mr Williams about its importance in the education sector and also in discussing other key areas My hon Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham was right to point out that the UK is highly regarded elsewhere in the world not just in traditional Anglophone countries but in the French speaking world in which I travel quite extensively given my additional and other responsibilities in Africa He was also right to imply that more needs to be done We certainly should not rest on our laurels but ensure that we are maximising the opportunities for UK businesses elsewhere in the world The support provided to businesses by UKTI has created significant economic benefits since May 2010 Indeed some 45 6 billion worth of total additional sales have resulted from UKTI assistance In 2011 12 UKTI support helped firms to create 36 400 jobs and secure a further 68 500 jobs The role of UKTI is not just to maximise exports for both large companies and SMEs in the UK but to persuade foreign companies to invest here in the UK too In that regard the UK has benefited from 1 406 inward investment projects in 2011 12 in which UKTI has been involved which have helped to create or safeguard more than 112 000 jobs in the UK It is therefore fair to say that UKTI is making a significant contribution to driving the UK s economic recovery I want to say a little about the background the architecture against which UKTI operates In early 2011 the Government published the White Paper Trade and Investment for Growth which outlined our commitment to an open trading system and to removing barriers and supporting UK firms that wished to export The Government s Plan for Growth which was published at the time of the 2011 Budget linked the policy objectives for greater global trade to our economic aim of providing a climate that would help businesses to grow and prosper The key objective was to encourage investment in exports as a route to a more balanced economy Some of the issues that my hon Friend has raised are particularly pertinent It might help his constituents and others who are unaware of the opportunities that UKTI offers to know that those opportunities are posted on the UKTI website and that companies can sign up to alerts for any opportunities that might be relevant to them I would certainly be happy to provide him with details of how to access that information which he can pass on to the relevant businesses in his constituency My hon Friend also raised the important issue of the Prime Minister s appointment of trade ambassadors I can give him an assurance that all the trade ambassadors not just my hon Friend the Member for Gloucester Richard Graham are very significantly engaged in the countries for which they are responsible Many of them have already made visits and many are planning with the missions on the ground as well as with the Department for Business Innovation and Skills to lead trade delegations to those countries It is also important to put on record that the Government are seeking a transformation of the UK s export and inward investment performance so much so that in November 2011 the Prime Minister and the relevant Minister the excellent Lord Green launched the national export challenge to encourage more SMEs to export As my hon Friend rightly pointed out in some markets the UK is below the EU average percentage of exporting SMEs We want to see it achieve at least that level if not higher To that end the Prime Minister has set the extremely ambitious target of getting another 100 000 companies exporting by 2020 and doubling UK exports to 1 trillion However UKTI cannot deliver the Government s ambition to transform the UK s export and inward investment performance alone It is working in close co operation with the rest of Government and particularly with the Department for Business Innovation and Skills and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Outreach with business intermediaries such as banks lawyers and accountants is also playing a major role We aim to access their client bases to help businesses to expand into key markets My hon Friend also raised the important subject of marketing He will understand the very challenging to put it politely macro economic situation that we inherited and it was absolutely right that when we came into office we looked at every aspect of Government expenditure to ensure that UK taxpayers money was being spent properly and that we could make a significant inroad into the huge deficit that we inherited That does not mean however that we have been unable to persuade the Cabinet Office which is the responsible Department to put in place marketing budgets when and where appropriate Perhaps the best example is the Great campaign which was linked to the Olympics and to our Olympic legacy I can inform the House that that campaign has had a significant positive impact persuading businesses based abroad to invest here and enabling our missions abroad to persuade UK companies to invest elsewhere in the world Indeed the House has played its part too with Members of Parliament hosting seminars in their constituencies to highlight the opportunities that exporting can offer businesses especially to small and medium sized enterprises I am grateful to my hon Friend the Member for Stourbridge Margot James who has played such a significant role in engaging and encouraging MPs across the House to hold such meetings in their constituencies If Members either here this evening or reading the debate in Hansard tomorrow are interested I would urge them to contact my hon Friend who will provide them with the information necessary to enable them to hold such meetings in their constituencies That is not all Last August the Government announced additional support to help UK businesses There will be more money available for SMEs to attend trade shows abroad and I very much hope that the constituents of my hon Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham will access this funding There will also be increased support available for travel on overseas missions Substantial discounts will be available and will be offered through the Overseas Market Introduction Service which provides targeted research to help businesses find those first crucial contacts in the markets In addition the autumn statement provided a further resource allocation of 70 million a year for the next two years This package of support will play an important role in helping realise the Government s ambitions by building up the capacity and capability of the British Chambers of Commerce overseas where we lag behind competitors such as the Germans Lord Green has made this a personal crusade and I am 100 supportive of the direction of travel It is focused initially on 20 pilot chambers in key export markets Once again I very much hope that my hon Friend s constituents will engage with this excellent new initiative Increasing the number of international trade advisers in the English regions is a key part of how the money will be spent offering additional funds to SMEs with high growth potential enabling more companies successfully to export I can inform my hon Friend that some of these advisers are private sector employees who are performance related rewarded exactly the agenda he talked about and I think that is exactly the right direction in which to go We hope that this additional funding will double the number of companies given financial support towards the cost of exhibiting at their first overseas trade shows and double the support for private sector led project teams campaigning for UK success by enhancing inward investment support in growth markets such as the UAE Qatar Kuwait and Russia I hope that some of that inward investment will end up in my hon Friend s constituency This is also about positioning the UK as the leading location of choice for European headquarters and elite global enterprises building on the success of Tech City and developing further inward investment campaigns as well as building on the Olympic legacy This has been an important debate My hon Friend is right to continue the work he is doing to raise the significance of the contribution that UK exports can make to our own UK economic recovery Question put and agreed to House adjourned

As a Conservative I am proud of our record of creating and supporting the evolution of the Union over a long period It was John Major who paved the way for the 500 million of EU and British Government growth funding that is controlled by Cornwall council and local businesses It was the Conservatives in this Government who announced the intention to recognise Cornish people as a national minority under EU rules based on Cornwall s distinct culture and traditions At the general election in 2010 I was proud to stand on a manifesto that committed us to a radical decentralisation of power from this place to my constituents and to people and communities across the UK Much progress has been made I know that people in Cornwall will be pushing on an open door if they want more decision making powers to be devolved It is not only our great cities that are the engine houses of innovation and sustainable growth but ambitious and forward looking places such as Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly I ask the Minister today to reassure me and my constituents that as the promises that were made to the Scottish people are debated and the mechanisms developed to ensure that they are delivered the commitments that have been made to the rest of the UK will also be delivered There was a promise of a wider constitutional and financial settlement It is essential that the allocation of resources around the UK is based on need That must be central to the plan For me the debate about devolution is not about a costly and distracting reorganisation of local or regional government in Cornwall with the introduction of more professional politicians and an assembly but about a carefully thought through plan for the further devolution of powers to people and communities including Cornwall council I am concerned that the Lib Dems have jumped on the Cornish nationalist bandwagon by demanding a Cornish assembly without consulting people in Cornwall At the last general election the political party that advocated a Cornish assembly the Cornish Nationalist party or Mebyon Kernow polled about 5 of people in Cornwall That is hardly a mandate for a Cornish assembly Cornwall faces many challenges and has considerable opportunities I will remain focused on the important issues for people in Cornwall improving their prosperity and well being and tackling the historically unfair funding of our public services I look forward to working with this Government to deliver for them

Like my colleagues I thank the right hon Member for North East Bedfordshire Alistair Burt for securing the debate and it was a privilege for me and my hon Friends to assist him in that I thank the Backbench Business Committee Such debates have taken place since 2008 I have been involved in them all since being elected in 2010 I also thank colleagues for their powerful resonant and quite modern speeches I say modern because they are here today to represent their constituencies in the year 2014 yet two of my colleagues parents were Jewish and survived the holocaust If they had not survived my colleagues would not be here That really does bring things home to me and is the reason I was always determined if I got elected to give my full support to the Holocaust Educational Trust and the Holocaust memorial day on 27 January All colleagues have alluded to the obvious reasons for the memorial day It is about the memory of those millions of people who died simply because of their race colour or creed Another reason relates to the modern day As other Members have mentioned we cannot forget what happened or let it go because if we did we would demean the memory of many people who were slaughtered in this desperate way and make it easier for society for nations and for people to continue to behave disgracefully My hon Friend the Member for Beckenham Bob Stewart made a strong point about when he was serving in Bosnia and the reality of genocide there That demonstrates poignantly powerfully and horribly what life and death really mean in such situations and it reminds us all of what is happening in the Congo and Syria and of the rise of profound political and religious extremism which has got worse over the past few years We all have views about why that has happened but it is undeniably continuing to get worse A number of colleagues have mentioned the Jobbik party in Hungary with 15 of the vote and another is the neo Nazi Golden Dawn in Greece with 12 MPs These things do not go away because humanity is basically interchangeable Feelings ignorance fear and anger are the same today as they were 5 000 years ago The only difference is that we now dress differently we have computers and a few other things and we drive very fast in cars which we could not do 500 years ago but humanity does not change However a positive aspect of humanity is a continuous determination to get better to improve and to be kind and generous Alongside all the horror that the Holocaust Educational Trust helps us to understand as parliamentarians and Holocaust memorial day helps us to remember and commemorate those who died there is the other side of human nature That is also part of this remembrance I shall give colleagues an example There is a country at the moment that does not get a busting lot of good media coverage in the Daily Mail and the rest called Bulgaria Perhaps all hon Members know I did not know until a few months ago that although Bulgaria is smack in the middle of the Balkans and central Europe and has had a history of virulent anti Semitism for hundreds of years the Bulgarian people would not accept what the Nazis wanted so 50 000 Jews survived in Bulgaria Is that not fascinating That is the flip side of this horror of the holocaust so many good things were done As another colleague said we should not forget the individual families in Poland and other parts of Europe who saved Jewish families at enormous cost to themselves I was determined to mention the 50 000 Jews saved in Bulgaria in the Chamber today because whenever I read certain papers at the minute I find that poor old Bulgaria does not get a lot of good coverage So I pay tribute to that nation in my small way as a Member of Parliament within Westminster for what its people did A lot of the Bulgarian Government wanted to go along with the Nazis and pack all 50 000 Jews off but the Orthodox Church in Bulgaria and the people there just would not have it

I agree with the hon Gentleman that there is no long term solution without reconciliation and reintegration but it would be a mistake to judge Afghan society by our own standards While I was in Helmand I was astonished to see an attitude survey suggesting that Afghans object to the level of bribes not their existence They accept the existence of bribes as part of everyday lives but they do not like their reaching extortionate levels We have to go with the grain of Afghan society but he is absolutely right that the willingness and ability of the political elite to manage reconciliation to a successful conclusion will ultimately determine whether the process succeeds

Many agencies let down the children involved in the Rochdale sex abuse cases and the whole House must agree that offering our looked after children a safe and secure place to live is paramount In that context given that there are wide concerns about the operation of private children s homes in the area will the Prime Minister do two things Will he look at holding an inquiry into whether they are properly funded and have properly trained staff and will he make sure that monitoring now works effectively Clearly it has not done so

I congratulate the hon Member for Moray Angus Robertson on securing a debate on what all hon Members accept is an important matter I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond if not to all the hon Gentleman s questions he acknowledged that he asked a great many I will attempt to answer as many as I can and where I am unable to do that we will write to him in due course Air safety is of paramount concern not only to me but clearly to everyone in the RAF and in the Ministry of Defence I am well aware of the hon Gentleman s interest in the matter He is a consistent questioner of the Department on the subject I am therefore pleased that we have an opportunity to have a debate about it and to talk specifically about the RAF s fast jet operations I pay tribute to the men and women of the RAF who operate fast jets and dedicate their service to the defence of our country The hon Gentleman rightly raised concerns about the tragic loss of Squadron Leader Sam Bailey Flight Lieutenant Hywel Poole and Flight Lieutenant Adam Sanders when two Tornadoes collided above the Moray firth near his constituency two years ago last week My thoughts and sympathies are also with the families and friends of those who died so tragically I wish to make it clear from the outset that the RAF is satisfied that all risks to life associated with the operation of its fast jets are both tolerable and as low as reasonably practicable ALARP If that were not the case the RAF would not fly these aircraft I can assure the House that air safety is at the core of all the RAF s aviation activity I am sure the hon Gentleman will accept that no flying can ever be without risk yet prior to that tragic loss and despite the proximity events to which he has referred there has not been a mid air collision involving RAF Tornado for 13 years The service inquiry into the tragic loss two years ago has been painstakingly thorough taking more than 100 witness statements including 60 interviews within three weeks of the incident It concluded in November 2013 that the cause of the accident was lack of recognition of converging flight paths Seventeen contributory factors were identified of which only one was lack of a collision warning system The purpose of the service inquiry was not to attribute blame but to ensure that we learn lessons from that tragic incident and do whatever we can to prevent it from happening again The MOD has accepted liability for the incident and will continue to liaise closely with the families affected As the matter is subject to further legal proceedings it would not be appropriate for me to comment further In recent years and in particular following the publication of the Nimrod review which was undertaken by Charles Haddon Cave QC in 2009 significant work has been undertaken to improve flight safety Not least we have now established an independent military aviation authority the role of which is to regulate all military aviation activity and to assure my right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Defence that risks are being managed to an acceptable level Since 2010 all aviation risks are owned and managed by named duty holders They are very senior suitably qualified and experienced officers who are personally and legally accountable for the safe operation of their aircraft The risk of mid air collision is well known to the MOD and a great deal of work has been undertaken to reduce it both in the UK and overseas At the time of the incident the MOD was in the process of introducing the centralised aviation data service a pre sortie planning tool that allows aircrew to plan a sortie and identify what other aircraft have planned routes in the vicinity That planning tool is but one of a range of measures in place to minimise the risk of mid air collision Others include extensive aircrew training designed to ensure that pilots are fully aware of their surroundings use of transponder equipment in military aircraft aircraft and ground based radar and air traffic control It is clear from the hon Gentleman s remarks that he believes that a collision warning system would have prevented that tragic accident but it is simply not possible to be that definitive The service inquiry did not conclude that the lack of a collision warning system caused the accident The inquiry specifically stated that it is not possible to completely remove the risk of colliding with another aircraft regardless of the controls and mitigations put in place Therefore a collision warning system is not a panacea It cannot guarantee that a mid air collision would never happen again A CWS provides an additional level of security and another tool for the aircrew to use The majority of RAF fleets have a collision warning system or a plan to fit such a system Airborne collision avoidance systems are installed on all RAF multi engine transport aircraft The Hawk T2 which the hon Gentleman mentioned has a traffic collision avoidance system TCAS II fitted and we are currently in the assessment phase to fit a system to Hawk T1 However such capability on front line fast jets remains developmental It is not simply a matter of fitting existing equipment that is available for civil registered aircraft The Ministry of Defence is in fact a lead within Europe for the development and embodiment of CWS on existing fast military jets That is despite the technological and operational challenges of retrofitting such a system to fleets whose performance far exceeds that of normal aircraft profiles and performance In answer to the hon Gentleman s question we have initiated a programme to fit Tornado aircraft with a similar system This is currently being trialled on two aircraft and a third has been fitted for further development On current planning we intend to introduce this capability in stages from later this year Analysis is currently under way into the potential to fit a collision warning system on to Typhoon aircraft but it is too early to provide a timetable for development of this capability The hon Gentleman asked some specific questions in response to a previous written parliamentary answer I provided to one of his questions I am not in a position to be able to give him any further comfort on why this is the case other than that it is a very complex process and that at this stage we are not far enough along in that process to be able to give clarity on either timetable or cost Looking forward the F 35 Lightning II will have a limited collision warning system in its early capability block which is supplemented by advanced sensors and software to provide pilots with a much higher level of situational awareness than our existing platforms On the hon Gentleman s concerns about the procurement for the Tornado collision warning system it is a matter of record that the commitment to fit a collision warning system to Tornado aircraft was made in the 1998 strategic defence review Developing such a system proved difficult and attempts to develop a bespoke solution were unsuccessful during the early part of the past decade It was only in 2008 that a commercial off the shelf collision avoidance system was identified as a potential solution for the Tornado GR4 fleet and detailed design work began in December 2012 following the award of a contract to BAE Systems It is true that the programme had been cancelled in April 2011 I think the hon Gentleman said it was in 2010 as part of measures to bring the Department s equipment budget back into balance but that decision was revised within three months clearly demonstrating the success of the post Nimrod review duty holder construct The duty holder elevated the risk to the then Secretary of State my right hon Friend the Member for North Somerset Dr Fox on 14 June 2011 who within a week directed that the collision warning system should be reinstated Of course fitment of a collision warning system to the Tornado fleet was not the only recommendation in the service inquiry The other procurement recommendation was for new automatic personal locator beacons which were contracted last month and are due to enter service in autumn 2015 I would like to reassure the hon Gentleman that the service inquiry findings were reviewed as a matter of urgency throughout the MOD and substantial progress has already been made in implementing the 42 recommendations I can answer one specific question posed by the hon Gentleman in relation to the Tornado airworthiness review team report of 1994 which has been released by Defence Equipment and Support under a freedom of information request In conclusion we recognise that air safety is not just about equipment Risk management and training form an integral part of safety management The RAF seeks to improve all aspects of its safety management system which holds at its core the principle of continuous improvement I would like to make it clear that the safety of our aircrew other aviators and the general public and protecting our aircraft to maintain a defence capability are of utmost importance to the RAF Question put and agreed to House adjourned

The Minister is right The new commission will cost twice as much We had that argument previously I know that 48 times two does not equal 70 but if any hon Member can give me an example of a Labour Government s projection and the relevant figures at the end of the year for which it was done coming in below that same projection I shall withdraw my comments If the Government estimate 70 million the commission will cost more than that The current 48 million is probably money well spent and I do not therefore argue for a cut in spending on such an important matter My hon Friends and I always argue for spending the smallest possible amount of taxpayers money yet if the Government plan to put three bodies under one administrative roof there must be economies of scale and the current budget of 48 million should be reduced Nevertheless given that the new commission can rightly cover six strands of work instead of three that budget will clearly increase However if one decreases and then increases a budget one should not predict spending twice the amount of taxpayers money

I too have seen that survey Any action that the Minister takes will be warmly welcomed by the public across the whole of the United Kingdom by people of all ages and all genders This is a really important bit of work and I hope that the Minister will take it seriously I am concerned about the action taken so far I am concerned that in December 2015 when we had the Overseas Territories Joint Ministerial Council the Government failed to persuade those territories to implement public registers I am concerned that in March 2015 the Cayman Islands and the British Virgin Islands refused to meet Ministers from the Foreign Office and the Treasury I am concerned that they failed to meet the Financial Secretary s request that they adopt registers by November 2015 I am concerned that as I understand it they have ignored letters from UK Ministers I am deeply concerned that tax is not even on the agenda for the forthcoming meeting of the Overseas Territories Joint Ministerial Council I hope that the Minister can address that point We do have the powers and as was mentioned in a previous intervention we have used them before The Government must act If the Minister could at least tell us that he will set a timeline at the end of which if matters cannot be resolved in a collective and collaborative way with the overseas territories and the Crown dependencies the Government will use their power That would go a long way to settling some of our concerns today I hope that he can at least consider that as a possibility for taking the matter forward May I briefly comment on some of the other provisions in what is a warmly welcomed bit of legislation On the unexplained wealth orders it is particularly welcome that they will be applicable no matter where in the world the offence takes place May I ask the Minister two questions If the money comes from an overseas territory a developing country for example will there be a notification to that country of the setting of an unexplained wealth order Again our enforcement agencies will be more capable than some others in pursuing laundered money

My hon Friend is right to draw attention to the risk of this outbreak being contagious across borders given how close it is to the Ugandan border The WHO and others are working with neighbouring countries to make sure that people are screened at the border that there is a sufficient supply of vaccines and as I mentioned earlier that vaccines are approved for use within countries We are taking all the steps we can but what makes this outbreak so challenging is as he rightly says the prevalence of violent individuals disrupting the work of the health workers and peacekeepers

I pay tribute to Ms Samuels who brought her case as far as the Supreme Court Hopefully her struggle will result in change so that others do not have to go through this This case should be a wake up call for many local authorities in how they process homelessness applications while acknowledging that Scotland has much stronger homelessness legislation Local authorities have been left in a very difficult situation because of this Government s policies which drive cases like that of Ms Samuels Local housing allowance rates have been frozen at 2015 levels by this Government Why will that freeze continue into next year The Minister simply cannot say that this is about not wanting to subsidise the private rented sector because the Government are actively doing that by not building social housing In the four years to 2018 Scotland delivered 50 more affordable housing units per head of population and this is the important one five times more social rented properties per head of population and more in total than England The Scottish Government are also spending 12 million on discretionary housing payments to mitigate the Government s freeze on benefits such as local housing allowance and 50 million to mitigate the bedroom tax A perfect storm has led to so many of us having cases like that of Ms Samuels at our surgeries punitive arbitrary and punishing cuts to social security including housing benefit coupled with rent increases and a devastating under supply of social housing When will the Government wake up to the crisis they are causing

It is a pleasure to follow the hon Member for Lewes Maria Caulfield Her final statement outlining the choices facing the Government which was very pertinent and important As she said we cannot continue to remain in this situation which I have described as limbo where we have no decisions at all being made in part of the United Kingdom In western Europe we are the only part of a modern advanced democracy where people who are entirely unelected and unaccountable wield enormous power And that power is mainly used to do nothing to stop things they say that they can t that they won t and that they have no remit which is an appalling state of affairs in a modern democracy The only people I suppose who have more power than the permanent secretaries in Northern Ireland are people like European Commissioners probably equally unaccountable to many people as well We are leaving the European Union to restore accountability but in Northern Ireland we are passing legislation to increase and prolong the rule of permanent secretaries in Northern Ireland with a few exceptions of course There have been certain times when the Government have brought forward legislation to intervene the Budget is the biggest example but there are others We remember that as part of the Stormont House agreement Sinn Féin members actually supported and were willing to have direct rule on the issue of welfare payments because they did not want to put up their hands for welfare reform changes and cuts in the Northern Ireland Assembly and were quite happy to see it transferred to Westminster We talk about their opposition but to those Members who think that direct rule is such a terrible thing in Northern Ireland that nationalism would be outraged I say that they should just remember that Sinn Féin actually encouraged it and wanted it to happen when it came to difficult decisions in Northern Ireland Sometimes people actually find it very convenient to allow Westminster to take these decisions when it suits them but of course it is an absolute constitutional outrage when it is a different type of decision to be made and then all sorts of terrible consequences can emerge

I agree entirely with my right hon Friend that is exactly what is necessary The question is how to achieve that We need a political framework within which a negotiated solution can take place I think that it should be possible to get a solution to the situation in the middle east even though people say It s been going on for decades so how on earth can you be optimistic about that in any shape or form particularly given the suffering of people on the Palestinian side and not to mention the lack of security in parts of Israel too The reason why I think that that is possible is because everyone is now agreed that we want a two state solution The territorial issue has to be solved which can done and there are issues to do with right of return and Jerusalem which are difficult but not incapable of resolution but the rest of it is just to decide for peace If there were peace the Palestinian territory would of course attract massive investment That is what is so tragic about the current situation As we have learned from the example in Northern Ireland where there is peace we get economic development I agree entirely with my right hon Friend but what is needed is for everybody all the key parties to agree to the basic principles of the framework that I hope we will be able to set out in the near future

It is a great pleasure to follow the right hon Member for East Hampshire Mr Mates I rarely quote from The Sunday Telegraph but today I want to quote from an article by Matthew d Ancona in that paper because he presents the case and asks the appropriate question better than I could when he says We face a threat that is indeed new in scale ambition and complexity The question is whether we have what it takes as a society to respond to novelty with new strategies I had the privilege of being a member of the Committee that considered the Bill It was a privilege because unlike other Committees on which I have sat it took a significant amount of evidence so that everyone began to feel that they understood the wide parameters of the Bill that we were possibly attempting to improve but most certainly hoping to achieve consensus on and support for The evidence spanned that from the secretary of the Coroners Society the Home Office terrorism specialist Lord Carlile the Metropolitan Police Commissioner the Association of Chief Police Officers Justice and Liberty A vast range of excellent evidence was presented and carefully scrutinised by the Committee We wanted to understand all opinions on terrorism whether about intercept pre charge detention or reserve powers so that we could ensure that we carefully walked the line that we have to walk between supporting and determinedly enabling individual civil liberties while at the same time delivering a secure society for everyone I probably found the evidence of ACPO the Metropolitan Police Commissioner and Lord Carlile to be the most convincing but all of it was very valuable The evidence of ACPO and the Metropolitan Police Commissioner which was added to by a letter that I understand was placed in the Library outlined the extreme and exceptional nature of potential and actual terrorist activity Clearly the argument made by both was to say put on the shelf a power that we could need We have taken cases to 27 and a half days only two that is right maybe six but when that power of detention is required it should be to hand That was a persuasive argument that I supported

Before the urgent question I was making the point that my hon Friend the Member for Dartford has said that the challenge in drafting the Bill was where to stop I am sure he knows where he wants to stop but as with so many things once something has started it is very difficult to stop because people always want to extend it There may well be the slippery slope towards including other medals and certificates Surely the principle would be the same it might one day be extended to long service medals private medals and all sorts of other things On who should be allowed to wear medals clause 1 3 the Bill states For the purposes of this section subject to subsection 5 personally entitled means being the person to whom the award in question was made Clause 1 5 states A person does not commit an offence under subsection 1 if the item is worn or the person represents themselves as being entitled to wear it a as part of a reconstruction or representation of historical events b as part of a filmed or theatrical or other live entertainment or production or c in honour of a family member who meets the requirements of subsection 3 The Library briefing on the Bill quotes the Royal British Legion s advice on the wearing or not wearing of medals Can I wear medals belonging to members of my family The official position regarding wearing medals other than your own is that they should not be worn However it was generally accepted from soon after the Great War that widows of the fallen wore their late husband s medals on the right breast on suitable occasions My hon Friend the Member for Beckenham made that point in an intervention The advice goes on More recently it seems to have become the custom for any family member to wear medals of deceased relations in this way sometimes trying to give a complete family military history by wearing several groups Although understandable it is officially incorrect and when several groups are worn it does little for the dignity of the original owners That is the official advice from the Royal British Legion In its written evidence to the Defence Committee inquiry the Naval Families Federation quoted the views of its members It asked the question If criminalisation of wearing unearned medals was introduced should there be specific safeguards for family members who wear the medals of deceased relatives If yes which family members should be safeguarded Please tick all that apply It received these replies Husband wife or civil partner was the most popular Unmarried civil partnered Parent Guardian Child Step Child Grandchild Extended family and Other By the look of the chart Other not including any of the others had about 14 of the responses The Royal Air Force Families Federation said in its written evidence to the Defence Committee Yes there should most certainly be safeguards for family members The key question is who qualifies The definition we use is anyone who is a blood relation but this may not be appropriate in these circumstances and can be difficult to prove on occasions Interestingly the MoD is struggling with its own definition of a family member but it may be sensible to align any definition for these circumstances with the MoD definition if and when they decide what it should be Otherwise it s probably a matter for common sense In the Bill there is an exemption for a family member but we are none the wiser about who is a family member Does it cover those categories such as Guardian or someone who was Unmarried Does it include someone who is married but not a blood relation

I want to make some points about fuel poverty which will be similar to those made by my hon Friend the Member for Sherwood Paddy Tipping and the hon Member for St Albans Anne Main The background to our debate is the fuel poverty suffered by one in six families in the country 4 4 million families 3 million in England alone and many of those in my Halifax constituency According to the consumer group Energywatch fuel poverty is when people spend more than a tenth of their income on utility bills Meanwhile British Gas has announced a 15 per cent increase in its bills and others suppliers EDF and npower have raised their prices by 27 per cent That is unacceptable but the unaccountable nature of those bodies means that they can get away with increases that hit the sick the elderly and the poor most A constituent wrote to me last week to ask When was the last time my salary increased by 27 per cent I fear that these price increases will send many of my constituents into fuel poverty We need action to bring the utilities into line We cannot sustain circumstances in which two thirds of British households are paying more and many vulnerable groups are afraid to heat their homes I must remind Ministers that there is a real danger that we will not be in a position to eradicate fuel poverty by 2010 which as was pointed out by my hon Friend the Member for Sherwood is a legal obligation May I make a plea First we should adequately fund the Warm Front programme which provides grants for poor households to insulate their homes Secondly we should ensure that utilities have an obligation to make their customers aware of social tariffs Thirdly we need a wide ranging Government inquiry into the home energy market What upsets me most about the Bill is that unlike the 2003 energy White Paper it makes no reference to how we can begin to end fuel poverty That is a lost opportunity and one of which I and other Labour Members will doubtless be reminded when we are campaigning on the doorstep It seems to me that energy companies are placing more importance on maximising their profits than on a willingness to offer subsidised tariffs to poorer households to help with their bills That issue affects Halifax today We need action now to ensure that another generation of people are not sucked into fuel poverty I call on the Government to make social tariffs compulsory if the reluctance to agree them voluntarily continues I find it grotesque that the companies to which I have referred made 2 billion in six months last year

It is characteristic of the Liberal Democrats to blame the Government for the weather On the hon Gentleman s serious question about energy efficiency and insulation there is more to do but it is important to point out that under our programmes 1 5 million homes a year are being insulated and getting the help they need The Warm Front programme which did not exist before has helped 2 million homes since its inception There is more to do That is why we are planning a decade long improvement in energy efficiency including a pay as you save mechanism to make it possible to do more

I agree absolutely and that is a very important point This NATO obligation is an unbelievably serious and important obligation We have stretched it absolutely to its breaking point If we are going to be serious about it we have to follow through and that absolutely means we should not be giving guarantees to people we have no intention of protecting We should not be writing cheques we are not prepared to have cashed The nub of this issue is of course that deterrence depends not on whether Britain would use a nuclear weapon but on whether the other side believes that we would use it Therefore the most important support for our nuclear warheads lies not in the Trident missiles or even the submarines it lies in the character of our nation which is why there is absolutely no point in our having a discussion about a nuclear deterrent without looking at our defence strategy and posture in general Deterrence cannot make sense if we get ourselves into a situation which I sometimes worry my hon Friend the Member for North Devon Sir Nick Harvey is getting himself into where we believe that simply investing in fancy bits of kit is going to keep us safe If people do not believe we are going to use them that we are serious about using them they will be entirely meaningless We can see the problems already so let us just run through the various justifications that have been laid out here for nuclear weapons The first was P5 membership The big question for Britain on P5 membership is whether we are serious about our role in the United Nations at all Why are we not contributing more to UN peacekeeping The subject of Iraq has been raised The big question on Iraq is not our posturing about caring about terrorism or saying it is a tier 1 threat but what we are actually doing At present on the ground outside Kurdistan while Australia has 300 soldiers and Italy and Spain are deploying 300 we have exactly three That means that Britain is not displaying and consistently demonstrating seriousness This is not about combat troops it is about being able to analyse the mission have an intelligent conversation with the Iraqi Government engage with our coalition allies and play the global role that our enormous defence budget is supposed to provide us with On Ukraine and Russia again we cannot simply rely on kit we need to be doing things The big question for us in Britain is how are we responding to the ambiguous warfare that we can see being propagated in Ukraine What kind of investments are we making in military intelligence What kind of investments are we making in cyber and in special forces How much do we understand the situation on the ground in Ukraine and Russia On NATO it is fine to talk about how important it is for us to be in NATO and to have nuclear weapons and indeed it is But it is meaningless if we are not going to stick to the commitments that we made in Wales of 2 of GDP The most important thing we can do to deter Russia now is to ensure that Russia believes that NATO is serious about defending itself If we say in a Wales summit that we will spend 2 of GDP and if we go around telling other countries to spend 2 of GDP and we should be telling other countries to spend 2 of GDP we must retain our own promise and commitment otherwise the nuclear deterrent will not be taken seriously Putin will look at us and ultimately conclude that there is a minimal chance of our doing anything if he were to intervene in the Baltic because in respect of the rapid reaction force commitments the framework nations Germany France and Britain appear to be struggling to commit in 2016 to maintaining a deployable brigade It seems to be very difficult to get the countries to work out how that will be funded in 2016 Whereas Russia can deploy 40 000 troops at 72 hours notice the NATO deployment rates are running at about six months If we do not reach out to the public which is why this debate is important if we do not talk about why Britain is a global power why we care about the Baltic why we care about the global order why we set up NATO why we have nuclear weapons in the first place all this will be lost To conclude the fundamental rationale for all this depends on something on which the hon Member for Newport West Paul Flynn and I disagree This is the nub of the disagreement do we believe in a world order Do we believe in NATO Do we believe Britain is a global power Do we wish to play a role in the world If we do I will vote in favour of those weapons but the deterrent will not make sense unless the character of the nation is in place otherwise what we will be doing is creating something a little like the gold inkstand on the Table a golden pinnacle on top of a cathedral when the foundations and the structure of that cathedral are lacking and the faith of the nation has been lost

My right hon Friend seems to be drawing a distinction between demonstrations outside Parliament and elsewhere Does he recall that a number of MPs including me were arrested outside South Africa house in 1984 The police decided to prosecute us bizarrely for behaviour that was offensive to a foreign mission to which we happily pleaded guilty given that the protest was against the apartheid regime in South Africa The court found us innocent on the basis that we had a moral right to protest As a result there was a permanent picket outside South Africa house despite many objections by the then South African embassy That played its small part in ending apartheid Surely my right hon Friend recognises that the right to permanent protest is enshrined in judicial precedent in this country

I am very grateful to the hon Lady and I am happy to do so We agree that when a woman presents herself at a refuge there can be an element of discombobulation to use the hon Lady s word However there comes a time perhaps in a matter of days or even longer in the case of particularly vulnerable victims of domestic abuse when with the support and help of professionals in the refuge or elsewhere they are able to make a complaint They can make a complaint to the police in the form of either a telephone call or attendance at a police station with support or they can get help from a solicitor and give them instructions to bring a case for a civil injunction or an ouster order That has to follow My point was that it is unfair to expect women to make a complaint immediately in the hours that follow their departure from home That is also true in many other contexts I think the hon Lady and I would agree that in the case of rape allegations the rather worrying aspect in the past was that the victim was often asked Well why didn t you go to the police immediately We know that that is not a good argument when it comes to serious offences such as rape which can take days months or years for people to report The point I am seeking to make is that there has to be some complaint procedure in the end Proposed sub paragraph 10 k in amendment 74 uses the term other well founded documentary evidence of abuse I know it is difficult to choose a precise phrase that sums up what the amendment s proposers would regard as a sound basis of fact but that term is open to too much interpretation when it comes to determinations on the granting of legal aid I think the proposers of the amendment are perhaps on sounder ground in proposed sub paragraph 10 h which mentions an undertaking given to a court that the perpetrator of the abuse will not approach the applicant who is the victim of the abuse If there is any criticism to be made of that it is that it is perhaps drafted a little too precisely Many undertakings given to courts in relation to domestic abuse include not just non approach but other prohibitions as to particular conduct contact and other aspects of the mischief that is the subject of the proceedings It is important that we consider the particulars of the matter because when parties come to court with a claim relating to domestic abuse there is quite rightly an impetus for compromise The parties represented by solicitors or counsel rightly see whether proceedings in the form of evidence given and tested before a judge can be avoided by undertakings being given Undertakings is a legal word for promises given by one or other party as to future conduct In fact in many cases both parties make promises not to behave in such a way as to cause future strife That is laudable and it has been the practice in the civil courts for many years It saves court time it saves victims of domestic abuse from having to undergo the trauma of giving evidence and it looks to the future by trying to draw a line under the sins of the past with regard to the conduct of people who have been in a relationship involving domestic violence Let us put ourselves in the position of a solicitor or legal adviser who has to advise a party to such proceedings before any decision is made about the giving of undertakings I see a problem occurring because if undertakings are not to qualify for the purposes of obtaining future legal aid in domestic violence cases solicitors will have to advise their clients that that could be the case In other words they will have to warn their clients that if they accept undertakings that could prejudice any future claim for legal aid That worries me for two reasons First it could provide a perverse incentive for more litigation which could result in fewer undertakings being given and a concomitant loss of court time and increase in expenditure Secondly it would place legal advisers in a very difficult position when it came to the giving of proper advice Solicitors or barristers should be there to give advice based on the evidence in the case rather than on any future contingency that may or may not occur Could there not be a way through that problem by parties in the case through their legal representatives inviting the judge who presides over the proceedings to indicate his or her view of the strength of the evidence If there were an injunction in which the parties were minded to accept undertakings the judge might say In this particular case I think there was very strong evidence that could have supported the granting of an injunction The legal representatives could then use that if there were any future domestic abuse leading to a legal aid application I urge the Government to consider that potential solution to the problem as I believe it could help not only the parties in a case but those who advise them legally This debate should not be about whether one party or another is sound on domestic abuse The truth is that there is a welcome and proper consensus about the seriousness of the incidence of domestic abuse in our society Politicians the police and all agencies are determined to stamp it out intervene prior to violence taking place and deal with the root causes of why one partner in a relationship should choose to abuse the other whether emotionally financially physically or otherwise This debate is not about whether or not we believe domestic violence is a problem rather it is about how the criteria are set It is therefore a rather narrow debate and it deserves more mature reflection than some Opposition Members have thus far given it I am sorry that Opposition Members do not consider 20 years of experience of actually dealing with domestic violence cases to be important because I would like to think that those of us who have dealt with victims of domestic violence have a contribution to make and I bitterly resent any Opposition suggestion especially in sedentary interventions that I am deliberately prolonging these proceedings I am not doing so and if that accusation is repeated I shall raise a point of order

I disagree with those bodies on this particular point but I take note of their opinions I do not know whether hon Members can adduce different evidence but the worst cases in which people commit suicide or experience a crisis such as a mental breakdown involve people taking on 16 different credit cards and personal loans while the data sharing system fails to catch the fact that debt is accumulating The interest rates involved in such cases are often far below those offered by doorstep lenders yet the cumulative effect of all that debt together with charges and the extension of credit limits produces the greatest tragedies If the right hon Member for Leeds West can point to competing evidence I would be interested to hear about it

I seek to support Durham CPS in a number of ways First I go to visit Durham CPS it has been a pleasure to visit its area offices Secondly I have a dialogue with the Director of Public Prosecutions on a monthly basis and if necessary more frequently when we keep the statistics under review I have often said that statistics can sometimes become a bit misleading if one becomes obsessed with them but they are a very good benchmark of quality Linked to that is the feedback that we get Equally what I pick up through the unduly lenient sentence system enables me to evaluate whether the system is working properly in the case of court presentation For all those reasons although I am certainly not complacent and I know that we constantly have to drive this agenda I am satisfied that the CPS has performed outstandingly on overall conviction rates On issues concerning rape and violence against women and girls raised by the hon Member for Luton North Kelvin Hopkins while I clearly have anxieties about areas where there may be lower rates the performance overall seems particularly in the hon Lady s area to be very good indeed

Two of the most misleading words in the political dictionary are Xreform and Xmodernisation They are nearly always used to camouflage proposed changes with ulterior and concealed motives and both therefore feature prominently on the cover of the report that we are debating We do not need to agree with the grand old Duke of York that any change at any time is always for the worse to know for a fact that some changes are not for the better As our constituents find in their personal lives changes are indeed often for the worse The House of Commons has been continually reforming and modernising its procedures and perquisites since Dick Crossman was Leader of the House in the 1960s I remember listening to debates almost identical to this 40 years ago When morning sittings were introduced they were a total flop not only lawyers and stockbrokers like me but a great many Labour trade unionists and the like did not attend in the mornings The Wilson Government quickly dumped the whole idea and everyone agreed that Dick had been too clever by half I hope that these proposals will have the same fate although I do not think there is anyone quite as clever as Dick Crossman in the present Government As the hon Member for Sunderland South Mr Mullin pointed out the object of the exercise should be to improve scrutiny of the Government by Back Benchers These proposals will have the opposite result When I first arrived here Ministers of all parties were genuinely in awe of the House of Commons I am bound to say that I have never grown out of that myself In his retirement Harold Macmillan told me that he was seldom able to lunch before the then twice weekly Prime Minister s Question Time so tense did he always feel at the prospect of facing questions from the House It would be encouraging to think that the proposal to take parliamentary questions before lunch was motivated by kindly considerations of that sort but I very much doubt it I am told that Ministers eat only sandwiches nowadays moreover their general behaviour demonstrates a complete contempt for the House and an absolute preoccupation with the media That in fact is what lies behind all these proposals Ministers have no great love of Parliament as an institution The proposed batch of so called reforms will undoubtedly make things worse The imposition of a permanent maximum 10 minute limit on Back Bench speeches will greatly increase the influence of the Executive and reduce the power of the Chamber It is a mistake to assume as someone did earlier that all parliamentarians are equal We are all equal in the sight of God but we are not equal as parliamentarians Some parliamentarians are very much abler and more experienced than others as well as being better speakers They are the ones whom the House and the country want to hear The modern development whereby speakers are selected largely by a computer I understand on the mathematical basis of how often they happen to have spoken during the current Session rather than on the basis of whether they have a special contribution to make is not desirable and is one reason why the House is usually almost empty of all but those who think they will be called to speak If we want to improve the standing of Parliament we should understand that the hours during which we sit have almost nothing to do with it What will determine Parliament s status are the personalities of those elected to this place their distinction their experience their character their independence and their capacity for oratory heart moving oratory Since Tony Benn left the House there is hardly anyone capable of producing that

We have had an interesting and wide ranging debate There has been a great deal of agreement across the House about the state of the crisis There is indeed a threat In today s Financial Times there is talk of large scale branch closures Adam Crozier has said that if the 150 million a year subsidy under the social network payment is ended 10 000 post offices could close He also said that the Post Office could operate with only 4 000 post offices and that that would be enough for the Post Office to fulfil its obligations yet the Minister and the Secretary of State say that they want to give the Post Office certainty How can they possibly give the Post Office certainty when the chief executive himself is making such remarks We all know that the role of the Post Office in our constituencies in the towns and villages is absolutely vital It is pivotal in many of the small communities Often as I go around my constituency I see post offices that are at the heart of the village and pivotal in supporting the shops that are attached to them They are very much part of the social fabric of villages too After all we have here an organisation with a unique brand It is a powerful retail network It has a massive head start with its 28 million customers It is a huge cash handler 90 billion a year goes through the tills of the Post Office which is quite phenomenal Why has it all gone so badly wrong How can it be losing so much money Why can it survive only on subsidy Why is the rural network losing 3 million a week Why have 3 200 post offices 17 per cent of the network closed since 1997 The Minister with responsibility for employment relations in postal services wrote to me the other day He said The decline is down to the failure of the Post Office to respond to the changes in the market place I put it to him and to the Secretary of State that part of the problem has been the actions or inaction of Her Majesty s Government I will not rehearse the saga of automatic credit transfer for which the Government were responsible It did save the Department for Work and Pensions many millions of pounds but think of the extra cost through the subsidy and of the redundancy payments to so many sub postmasters who suffered as a result of post office closures We have heard about the Post Office card account fiasco and about BBC licence applications being moved elsewhere I asked the Minister what discussions he the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department for Culture Media and Sport had had with the BBC It is largely independent under its charter but are you telling me Mr Deputy Speaker that Ministers did not have some say or influence in that We have heard about the many constraints that the Government have put on the commercial freedom of the Post Office and sub post offices We have also heard about the many other things that the Government could be doing to support the network Why have they not shown a bit more imagination Why is there not more initiative on the part of the Government Why for example has the Post Office only recently told sub postmasters that transaction payments which they receive for automated council tax gas water and electricity payments are being cut from 11 2p to 7p per transaction What about the DVLA Surely much more could be done to ensure that its service is firmly entrenched within post offices and sub post offices That is vital in terms of supporting businesses in post offices and sub post offices

The whole purpose of universal credit is to remove the disincentives to work that exist in our current welfare system driven both by the complexity of all the different benefits and by the couple penalty for whose removal my right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has campaigned for many years He is removing it or at any rate heading in the direction of removing it through universal credit but there may be more than we can do and I shall be happy to look into that

My hon Friend is absolutely right to highlight this because the IFS is absolutely clear that the cuts in tax credits target working families Those people will lose out from the changes not in this Bill but in the Budget that is why we voted against them This is not about making work pay it is about making working families pay As the party of working families we will be fighting those changes tooth and nail in the period ahead

The hon and learned Lady makes a powerful point and a slightly separate point if I understand her correctly I have been talking so far about mortgage prisoners I think she is referencing small business borrowers which is a separate issue on which I shall also be touching in this debate It is a very important issue because they too are vulnerable customers in many cases and need very similar protections to mortgage prisoners There has been some change on the matter of mortgage prisoners The FCA launched a consultation in March and proposed changing the mortgage affordability rules for customers who are up to date with payments but there is a shortcoming Its proposals only give lenders the option to apply the modified assessment It does not propose to introduce an obligation It is also welcome that in July last year UK Finance the banks trade association launched a voluntary agreement under which lenders committed to supporting existing mortgage prisoners to switch to an alternative product with their present lender but that does not help people to switch from the vulture funds and it does not seem to help Mr and Mrs Adams escape TSB s Whistletree fund even though they are with the same lender I hope that the FCA consultation will address and enforce that and make sure that people are not left in that difficult position How can we free the mortgage prisoners These mortgages were taken out many years ago back in 2007 some even before that well before the post crash rules came in These borrowers have proven their ability to pay for over a decade in making their payments Why do we have a computer driven affordability test that ignores the reality of the real world We have to move beyond computer says no to reality says yes These borrowers should be treated as grandfathered as regards the regulatory rules that came in later Banks should be obliged by the FCA to take people on and treat them as grandfathered be they existing customers or not and the new mortgages should be permitted without any regulatory penalty for the bank they move to The Treasury needs to take responsibility too The Treasury s UK asset resolution division has been selling off Northern Rock s loan book to funds such as Cerberus The instruction seems to have been to get the highest price at any price Indeed the head of UKAR who is paid more than 650 000 recently boasted in The Times about how much it had managed to get for its loan books His pay will rise to 823 000 next year if he completes the loan book sell off He is incentivised to achieve value for money not to consider the wider circumstances and necessary protections I hope the Minister will address that in his remarks There is real concern that the Government could be facilitating the creation of more mortgage prisoners When selling these books the Treasury should be making sure there are the proper protections so that borrowers do not unfairly lose out It claimed it did that in the case of Cerberus but that turned out to have certain shortcomings something I think the Treasury Select Committee should look into It is wrong for the Treasury to pursue the highest amount of cash at the expense of vulnerable borrowers who have been placed in a worse position than otherwise would have been the case Moreover if the Treasury is willing to sell mortgage books to vulture funds what is to stop the likes of Tesco Metro Bank and many others following that example That is why we need to consider a wholesale ban on selling these mortgages to unregulated firms full stop The best way to achieve that is through the regulation of the whole industry Regulating mortgages all mortgages will ensure that all customers are treated more fairly by mandating best practice in each and every case That might mean that when books are sold off a little less is achieved because they cannot enjoy the fruits of regulatory arbitrage but it will mean that vulnerable people get better protections and are more safely and carefully looked after There needs to be a better deal for business borrowers as well The hon and learned Member for Edinburgh South West Joanna Cherry rightly mentioned that issue just now Business loans above 25 000 are unregulated Time and again we have seen the results of this the Royal Bank of Scotland s Global Restructuring Group the Lloyds business support unit and others Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy We must treat them fairly so that they can focus on what they do best which is creating jobs and making our country more successful

It is a pleasure to follow the right hon Member for Suffolk Coastal Mr Gummer and I welcome this debate on energy security However I was surprised about the alarmist headlines about eight days supply The hon Member for Tunbridge Wells Greg Clark generally makes a reasoned and well balanced contribution to such debates and there are real issues to address but I agree with the hon Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey Simon Hughes that alarming industry and domestic consumers does not help I realise that the hon Member for Tunbridge Wells did not mention domestic consumers but people often do not read beyond the headlines and his statement was unjustified That is not to say that we should not address storage and supply to local industries I had a case in my constituency of a company on an interruptible supply having its gas cut off but that happened not because of a shortage of gas but because of pressure problems which were related to cold distribution and infrastructure there were a number of reasons and they may well need to be addressed When it comes to choosing which companies have their supplies cut off there are problems with advance notice In addition some companies have an alternative source but some do not and there is a problem with how long each is cut off There should be a fair rotation because of the impact on certain companies compared with their rivals I want to put on record the fact that I received enormous support and advice from the Secretary of State who demonstrated his knowledge of the issues when I raised them with him I am glad to say that the supply was reinstated protecting 300 jobs locally and 1 500 nationally There are issues to address but generally speaking bearing in mind that we are in the coldest period that we have had for 30 years supplies of electricity and gas have been pretty good and I add my support to those who will ensure that that continues through the winter months

There would be an additional saving to such businesses and it would depend on the rateable value of the premises An assessment would have to be made of that rate and the saving would accrue at that point Even if you propose to let me press my amendment to a Division Mr Hood I do not intend to do so I was seeking to make the point that there is merit in the Conservatives proposal I did not think it necessary to table an identical amendment because I am more than happy to give my party s support to their suggestion I was seeking to explore ways in which we could help particularly small companies that may benefit from additional assistance If people feel there are multiple ways in which that can be achieved I am open minded on the matter and I hope that those will emerge during this debate and our deliberations in Committee

May we have a debate on equal pay and when we do perhaps the Minister responsible can explain why the Government Equalities Office pays men more than women white people more than ethnic minorities and non disabled people more than disabled people Does the Leader of the House not agree that the Government Equalities Office should get its own house in order before it starts lecturing everybody else around the country about equal pay

Putting aside the issue of plastic waste and what the United Kingdom will do if the high demands made by China and the high prices paid change as well as whether we will be able to cope with that is the Minister not aware that the Environment Agency has reported that about half the 8 million tonnes of green bin waste collected each year in the UK has been exported and that 500 tonnes have been shipped unsorted to Indonesia which will be dumped in that country because it does not have adequate recycling facilities of its own What will he do about that scandal and to reassure those of us in the UK who are keen on recycling

My hon Friend might be on to a good point but once a new system were set up albeit not necessarily that outlined in new clause 4 the risk of such an event would be less than he suggests New clauses 5 6 and 7 effectively mirror new clauses 1 2 and 3 However they would impose a limitation by statute whereas new clauses 1 2 and 3 are permissive and would allow companies to limit auditors liability by contract if shareholders so wished New clause 8 combines the benefits of proportionality with those of a cap It would provide for a belt and braces approach that would combine the equity of proportionality with the safety net of a cap to guard against a catastrophic claim We have tabled the eight new clauses to help the Government Conservative Members have no vanity of authorship so we are happy to be corrected by the many skilled officials and draftsmen who serve the Minister Several events have taken place since Committee It was said in Committee that the Government would amend section 310 of the 1985 Act to permit auditors to limit their liability by contract with reference to proportionality if it were made clear that the audit profession the business community and investor organisations supported it and that such an amendment would enhance competition in the audit market and improve the quality of auditing I understand that all those conditions have been satisfied I shall deal with each in turn yet the Government have failed to table an amendment to address the matter The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales which represents the auditors of almost every listed company in the United Kingdom supports proportionality by contract and has said that the big four and mid tier audit firms which are the actual auditors of the listed companies support such reform Other accounting bodies especially the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland also support the reform It is thus clear beyond doubt that the Government s first requirement that the audit profession supports the reform has been met The CBI which represents larger quoted companies and the Quoted Companies Alliance which represents smaller quoted companies support the concept of auditors being permitted to limit their liability by reference to proportionality

The answer is that if we are a member of the treaty of course they could go to the European Court of Human Rights That is why the question of whether we should remain part of the treaty is important Nevertheless the decision would not take place in the UK legal system so they would not be able to stand on those European rights before UK courts or seek relief before the UK courts unless they had British rights under the British settlement That is the key part of what we might call the dualist approach and obviously the Strasbourg machinery clanks more slowly and does not take every single case going as the British courts are required to do We would see a massive reduction in the level of cases but also in the level of public concern On the detailed provisions on UK rights and UK responsibilities the Bill does not simply copy the text of the convention rights it is a UK Bill of Rights and the rights it contains are referred to as British rights The convention text is varied where needed Let me take the House through a few of the major headline changes The main qualification is that the right to life is brought more into line with domestic law on the ability to use force in self defence and to prevent crime The prohibition of forced labour is clarified so that it explicitly does not prevent people from being required to undertake work or training as a condition of receiving welfare benefits The right to respect a private and family life will no longer be available as a tool to avoid trial and punishment for criminal acts The scope for limiting the right to manifest one s religion or belief is reduced and the right is limited only to stop the causing or incitement of physical harm to others so far as is necessary to protect public order It is made clear that the right of free elections does not confer a vote on convicted prisoners or those who are not British citizens I hasten to add that we have constitutional settlements that allow European Irish and Commonwealth citizens to vote in certain cases which are matters for Parliament to extend as it sees fit The basic right should be that British citizens who are not prisoners should be able to vote The rights should not be used by those who are not British citizens to delay or avoid their deportation or extradition from the UK They could not be used to prevent public authorities from taking action in relation to a person to uphold national security or public safety when the authorities reasonably believed that a clear and present danger to national security or public safety was presented by that person although such action would not include the killing of that person because we do not believe that Governments should go around killing people unless it was already allowed under the right to life provision Such action would also not include the use of torture or inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment By getting the settlement right we can put national security at the heart of our constitution and our constitutional rights ensuring that the Government can protect our national and personal security To my mind that is the first call on Government In addition the Bill includes rights not set out in the text of the European convention They are in England and Wales the right to use force against intruders in a home so long as that force is not grossly disproportionate the right of a parent or guardian to challenge in court without undue delay the lawfulness of any removal of a child from their custody when the child is placed in custody by a public authority and the right for a British citizen to challenge extradition to another country on the basis that they should have the right to trial in the UK if the alleged crime is committed while the person in question is in the UK It does not displace basic rights in the UK legal order so all our other constitutional documents from Magna Carta onwards remain but provides an additional baseline of rights that apply in our nation Alongside the rights the Bill includes a list of basic individual responsibilities A person s basic responsibilities include obedience to the law rendering civil or military service when this country requires his support or defence supporting nurturing and protecting minor children to the best of his ability respecting and upholding basic public order without placing himself in significant danger seeking to support himself without recourse to a public authority to the best of his ability including but not limited to seeking work or gainful employment where he can and rendering help and assistance to other persons where reasonable and to the best of his ability including but not limited to help for elderly and disabled persons Those responsibilities are not direct obligations on individuals nor would they automatically confer new powers on public authorities Instead they will be taken into account when a court considers a UK right

I congratulate the hon Gentleman but his turnout was lower than my turnout Having said that many Members will know that in their constituencies the turnout particularly in local elections is woefully low The turnout among young people is woefully low I did 10 hustings I am sure he did 110 but I can tell the House that many young people told me that those who were able to vote did not know enough I agree with my hon Friend the Member for Totnes on that because we need to make sure that that information is got across We do not have the mechanisms at the moment to get the information to enough young people in a way that I would like I do not believe now is the time to consider lowering the age for the franchise and including 16 and 17 year olds We need to put our energies and efforts into the 18 plus group In my intervention I made the point that we have things that people can do at 16 but we have a lot of things that they cannot do The comments made by the hon Member for Huddersfield Mr Sheerman have been somewhat misinterpreted by the Committee I think the point he was trying to make is that we protect young people from a lot of things he happened to discuss child and sexual abuse If a young person gets involved in a bad group and eventually goes down the criminal path we treat them in a way that accepts their youth in law We treat them in a way that protects them and we hope they will learn the error of their ways before they enter the adult world when they would face extremely serious consequences We take that approach on a lot of things for young people We try to protect them from the evils of smoking drugs and drink I know that this is different in Scotland before someone bounces up and down to tell me so but we say that a young person still needs parental permission in our country to get married at 16 which I would suggest is a very young age to be getting married Now is not the time in an amendment to a Bill as important as this to decide that we have to review the whole franchise I do not accept that it is infantilising young people to treat them as what they are young people pre 18 the age at which the full weight and consequences of the law fall upon them Let me also point out to Opposition Members that people pay tax aged three if they happen to be a child star that has nothing to do with age So let us leave that one out taxation and representation is somewhat of a misnomer We say that young people are protected What we need to say is why those young people of 18 are then considered adults They can leave school they can leave full time education and enter the world of work They lose that protection of that twilight era between being a very young child and an adolescent and being a young adult

Of course not The subject under discussion is the situation in England excluding Greater London which has been dealt with in previous legislation as the Minister is well aware The proposals seem the sensible and obvious way of proceeding if there is a genuine desire for an all England workable regional government solution It is the absurdity and arbitrariness of the boundaries that have generated the most hostility to the Government s proposals Their only response is simply to say that it would take too long to conduct a boundary review before implementing a referendum but they are prepared to delay a referendum while a local government review is carried out Paragraph b of the subsection set out in the amendment deals with our concerns about pre legislative referendums My right hon Friend the Member for Charnwood Mr Dorrell pointed out that we are asking the public to vote for a pig in a poke They have no idea of what powers regional assemblies would have or what authority they would represent We must trust the Minister when he says that the detail is in a White Paper or consultation document but we would rather see the measures in place to ensure that people are aware of precisely what the powers and responsibilities of the regional assemblies would be if they opted for them including the tax raising powers There is an almost bizarre contrast between the Government s absolute and unshakeable commitment to ensuring that local government reorganisation is done and dusted reported on and established in black and white before a referendum is held and their apparent failure to set out the substance of the powers that will be given to the regional assemblies that will be created if the referendum is successful People will be asked to vote when the substantive issues are still unclear but we are told that the subsidiary issue must be resolved first Incidentally neither do the Government propose that the electoral boundaries of the districts used in a region for the election of regional assemblymen will be defined before a referendum takes place Paragraph c would require there to be substantial business support in a region before a referendum is called The Bill already provides for a so called test of an appropriate level of interest in holding a referendum although that is undefined One of the Government s principal arguments in favour of regional assemblies has been that they will boost regional economic growth At the very least that case has not been proven Indeed in Scotland the opposite appears to be the case Scotland has enjoyed negative if that is the right word GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2001 and the first quarter of 2002 which is the classic definition of a recession Overall in the year up to the second quarter of 2002 its GDP grew by just 0 3 per cent which is not much more than a 10th of growth of the UK as a whole

There is a whole series of measures in respect of which it will make no difference whether we are in them or out of them We have no objection to opting out of a series of redundant measures However there must be proper assurances and guarantees about the measures that we need to opt back into Rather than a massive transfer of powers this is as the Prime Minister said more like a massive transfer of hot air There is not the substance in this to justify the Home Secretary s parade of historic significance and celebration of sovereignty Although the Home Secretary has not set out any major benefits from opting out of these measures we know that there are risks to the serious measures where even she now admits we need to opt back in She has no guarantees in place and no assurances from the Commission or the Council that at least on the most important measures the arrest warrant data sharing joint investigations we will be able to opt back in She will know that the House of Lords pointed out that when Denmark exercised its opt out the Commission had frequently refused permission for the Danes to conclude agreements in certain areas Nor has she any guarantee on the timetable or for example whether we will simultaneously be able to opt back into the European arrest warrant whether there will be a gap in its operation or whether complex or risky transitional arrangements will need to be negotiated Given how important the Home Secretary herself has said the European arrest warrant and various other measures are surely it is important to ensure that there is no gap in operation She can provide no assurance for the police that there will no interruption therefore of their use of the arrest warrant The House of Lords report also said that the Government have not provided us with even a summary of the reactions of the other Member States to the Government s intention to exercise the opt out which may be critical in assessing the potential success or otherwise of the UK s negotiation to rejoin particular measures Surely on these most important measures she should seek assurances from the Commission and the Council before she asks this House to opt out

My hon Friend is right We listened carefully but like the Leader of the Opposition the shadow Chancellor did not rule out a jobs tax Why Because it is Labour s tax of choice That is what they did in government when they increased national insurance and what they proposed at the general election A couple of years ago the shadow Chancellor admitted that he would be minded to do that as a means of bringing order to the public finances his weapon of choice is a jobs tax That is Labour s answer to jobs tax them destroy them make people unemployed That is why every Labour Government in history have left the House with unemployment higher than when they entered office

That is a very fair point and I pay tribute to the hon Gentleman who as I recall has been a champion for such people in the past That work will continue The new employment model represents a significant update to the offer providing support to service personnel who want to buy their own homes promoting greater domestic stability and lifestyle choice for service personnel and families and delivering simpler and more transparent systems for pay and accommodation grading but the challenges placed on defence and the needs of our people continue to evolve In SDSR 2015 we committed to build on the foundations of the new employment model to ensure that the future offer remains competitive and sustainable We have grouped this under the armed forces people programme For example we are now looking to see how we can make life easier where possible for those struggling to meet their full military commitment With the flexible engagement system we will be able to offer service personnel the opportunity to work part time and when needed protect individuals from deployments This means that we can reduce liability for deployment for a period so 27 year old Sergeant Jenkins for example can support his pregnant wife and spend more time with his young family in those important early childhood years We know that the provision of affordable good quality accommodation is also central to our offer to service personnel Yet again though we recognise that the current accommodation model does not always support how service personnel might choose to live forcing some to opt out of subsidised accommodation or compromise on family life The future offer will look to provide current service personnel with more choice of housing and help to meet their aspirations for home ownership regardless of age rank or relationship status That is just a glance at what we are doing Let me reassure the House that the armed forces people programme will deliver real improvement developing a future offer that will promote diversity and individual choice support flexibility and take account of personal circumstances Above all it will continue to evolve reflecting changing needs and aspirations In short it will be more effective for our people and more efficient for defence

The hon Member for Somerton and Frome Mr Heath clearly set out his objections to the retention of the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud His new clause addresses that in detail As he said there is no difference between us in respect of having this particular offence in common law for any longer than is strictly necessary the difference between us is simply to do with approach and how we get around to dealing with this matter The general thrust of the Second Reading debate in the other place on 22 June 2005 was that the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud needs to go Such great legal minds as those of Lord Lloyd of Berwick and my noble Friend Lord Kingsland the shadow Lord Chancellor carefully explained why it needed to go not least because it led to a lack of clarity in the criminal law If there is one thing that the criminal law should provide it is clarity so that those who might come within its reach know precisely what it is that they are liable to be held responsible for before they decide whether or not to do something I do not think that in the end there is much difference in approach Either one abolishes the offence now or one adds a sunset clause to the Bill saying that it will be abolished after a certain period of time or one accepts the Government s word that they will genuinely and actively review the law over the next three years and report back to us I suspect that once it has been considered how the new law has bedded in a decision will be made that reflects the spirit of the debates in this House and the other place I am prepared to accept the Government s word for present purposes and I urge the hon Member for Somerton and Frome to do so as well He does not have to accept their word on all things but on this matter perhaps he might On that basis I trust that we can put this issue if not to bed at least on the sidelines for three years while the Government keep a close eye on what is going on

Yes absolutely although I hope that the hon Lady will join Conservative Members in the Lobby to try to insert such a provision in this Bill so that it is not for a future Conservative Government to carry that out It will be apparent from what I have said that the treaty s impact on foreign policy making is more substantial than the Government have conceded and its potential impact dramatically so I am conscious of the time but let me give a final illustration of that the creation of the new EU foreign policy fund under paragraph 47 of article 1 of the Lisbon treaty The Government demanded that decisions about the fund should be taken by unanimity but believe it or not that was only a searching question They capitulated and such decisions will now be made by qualified majority voting including decisions on what amounts will be contributed by member states The matter links foreign policy with defence as the new fund is seen by some to be the first step towards a common defence budget for the EU My hon Friend the Member for Woodspring Dr Fox will of course wish to refer to the defence provisions when he winds up the debate but I want to make clear now our concern about the extent nature and implication of those provisions

Compulsion to take out annuities is increasingly regarded as a barrier to saving for retirement so we need a wider range of options The amendments would give greater flexibility as to the minimum income to be drawn down from an ASP thus creating a more attractive alternative to an annuity There is cross party support in the Lords for the principle and it is time for the Government to decide whether they want to be part of the consensus or to continue in their dogged determination to oppose giving people choice over how they manage their retirement funds

I agree with the Secretary of State s last answer and I stress that if we are to find a way of bringing closure to the victims of the most difficult cases that haunt us from the past that has to be done in an even handed fashion It would be wrong for example if Bloody Sunday soldiers were prosecuted but loyalist or republican paramilitaries were not

Given that we spend 300 million a year on incarcerating foreign national offenders in this country it makes sense to use the DFID budget to build prisons in other countries so that they can be returned Would the Minister be kind enough to consider Pakistan Bangladesh and Vietnam for future projects

Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker for calling me to make my maiden speech in this important debate I thank the hon Member for Oxford West and Abingdon Nicola Blackwood for an eloquent and elegant contribution I also single out my hon Friend the Member for Houghton and Sunderland South Bridget Phillipson It is so good for the House that women with her experience have been elected to serve It is customary to pay tribute to one s constituency in a maiden speech I am pleased to say that I am not in the position of my hon Friend the Member for Ealing North Stephen Pound who appeared to have to work hard in 1997 to find something interesting to say about his constituency However he managed the story from June 1889 when a giant circus elephant collapsed and died on Castlebar hill I quote from his maiden speech The great pachyderm with its last few breaths bravely staggered forward and is to this day to be found beneath the road unfortunately just over the constituency border in Ealing Acton and Shepherd s Bush I am delighted that for me the task is entirely easy and pleasurable East Lothian is without doubt a constituency blessed in almost every way imaginable It positively drips with scenic beauty Not only is it blessed with breathtaking natural beauty it has a continuous golden thread of historical significance Those golden colours are reflected in the wonderful art of local artist John Bellany who grew up in Port Seton The constituency s natural beauty ranges from magnificent beaches through agricultural farm land to rolling hills and features everything from Cistercian monks to the resting place of Concorde Even with that embarrassment of riches I have not mentioned its greatest asset its people East Lothian is blessed with genuinely close knit and vibrant communities It is a part of this country that has a real and thriving sense of self Its strong sense of identity means that even in these most difficult times for the newspaper industry it is served by three local newspapers The existence of the East Lothian Courier East Lothian and Musselburgh News and the Evening News is not a leftover from a past age but the reflection of a community with deep roots and a strong sense of social justice The communities of East Lothian range from former mining and fishing villages through to castles and keeps from the market town of Haddington to the fiercely proud mining built communities of Prestonpans Tranent Wallyford Macmerry Ormiston Elphinstone and Whitecraig At the east end of the constituency sits Musselburgh the honest toun which now has one of the top five race courses in the country The constituency s people have a long history of not being easily pushed around and not tolerating social injustice Those battles have not been fought only in this country The men who left East Lothian to fight against Franco s fascists in the Spanish civil war have their names inscribed on a plaque in Prestonpans As well as brave men East Lothian also has a proud history of brave women My predecessor Anne Moffat was the first woman to represent East Lothian She began her working life as a nurse and went on to become president of Unison Becoming the Parliamentary Private Secretary to my right hon Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle Alan Johnson when he was Secretary of State for Health was a real source of pride to Anne She cared deeply about the NHS and her first hand experience of working in the wards equipped her well for that post The House will be aware that Anne has suffered poor health in recent months and I am sure all hon Members will join me in wishing her good health and happiness Anne paved the way for other women to represent East Lothian I am sure that I will not be the last but she was not the first woman to stand up for working people in my constituency There is a statue in Tranent by sculptor David Annand of Jackie Crookston beating her drum with a small child at her side to commemorate the massacre of Tranent in 1797 Women from mining communities across the county beat their own drums to protect their communities during the miners strike of 1984 That dispute and those months of hardship almost tore those communities apart as some men returned to work Fiona Hunter then aged only 12 wrote a poem called Hang on Dad for a school project Don t go down the mine Dad Where some of them have gone Hang on a little longer Dad Don t let them think they ve won I know it s hard to feed us Dad But we ve hung on so long It can t go on much longer Dad Much better times must come It is hard to believe that those are the words of a child of 12 The common endeavour of the miners their families and the communities of East Lothian bound them close together so my constituency is clearly one that does not easily lend itself to dissection the arbitrary redrawing of boundaries and the random consequence of arid mathematical formulas dreamt up in Conservative central office and breathed into life in Whitehall The coalition Government cannot take a community such as East Lothian with its sense of self its sensible and natural boundaries and institutions and its hundreds of years of organic community development and simply apply the chainsaw of narrow party advantage in the way that has been proposed As I was campaigning I was proud to mark Labour s record and I now want to make a pledge to the people of East Lothian Her Majesty s loyal Opposition will fight to stop the Government s proposals to weaken democracy and my role in representing you I thank the House

I commend my hon Friend s persistence in pursuing that point I believe that he realises that we are sympathetic to his point of view online consultation is opening the scrutiny of law to a much wider public The website www tellparliament net which is managed for us by the Hansard Society is becoming widely known That is not contradictory and would not exclude the BBC from taking such opportunities further but I caution that such matters are also for Committees of the House as well as for my hon Friend

I pay tribute to my hon Friend the Member for Mitcham and Morden Siobhain McDonagh for her work in preparation for the debate and to my right hon Friend the Member for Enfield North Joan Ryan for the way in which she opened it I want to focus on the impact that the Government s so called national living wage is having and could have on the care sector following the theme raised by the hon Member for Inverness Nairn Badenoch and Strathspey Drew Hendry The care sector is under increasing financial pressure and many organisations have warned that the Government s failure to provide additional funding for the national living wage could result in a number of care providers becoming financially unviable It will also have an impact on the pay and working conditions of care staff The Local Government Association has estimated that introducing the Government s national living wage will cost home care and residential care providers at least 330 million this year A number of Members have mentioned the social care precept In my local area of Salford the precept can raise only 1 6 million but the cost of the national living wage increase to the care sector is 2 7 million It has clearly been left to taxpayers to pay for with a mechanism that is not even sufficient Care England says that the Government s national living wage announcement places additional unfunded pressures on the care sector that it cannot cope with Care providers have already had to fund the National Minimum Wage increase of October 2015 plus standard Cost of Living increase in contracts from local authorities and increases in Care Quality Commission regulatory fees The aggregate impact of all of these increases is substantial providers estimate that this will cost them a 5 rise in the wage bill in the first year and 7 each year thereafter I have already been told that like other businesses some care providers have altered their employment contracts and conditions as a way of coping with those changes meaning that additional costs from the national living wage are being paid for by careworkers themselves As we have heard many careworkers are already underpaid The National Audit Office has reported that up to 22 000 home care workers in England are illegally paid below the national minimum wage and I believe the actual figure is much higher In HMRC investigations of care providers between 2011 and 2015 more than four out of 10 were found not to be complying with the national minimum wage The Resolution Foundation has calculated that careworkers are collectively cheated of 130 million a year due to pay levels below the minimum wage That is done through a variety of mechanisms such as careworkers not being paid adequately for travel time despite statutory guidance As one careworker has said In order to earn a full time wage the carers in our company usually start work at 7 am and work until 9 pm five six days a week with gaps throughout the day where we wait in the car until due at the next client Some careworkers are paid as little as 3 50 per hour when lack of pay for travel and waiting time is considered

The right hon Gentleman expresses his point very powerfully The mandate for the UN panel of experts to continue its work is one of the topics being considered at the UN Human Rights Council meeting which started this week It is vitally important that the work of this group is able to continue so that it can ensure that all potential violations of international humanitarian or human rights law by any side in this conflict are investigated thoroughly by a neutral panel There is serious concern that at the HRC Saudi Arabia and the UAE might try to block the extension of the panel of experts mandate Will the Minister say when he responds to the debate whether the UK Government believe that the coalition may well try to do that and if so how will the UK work to ensure that this vital body can continue In particular will he confirm to the House today that the UK will give its support to the work of the panel when this issue is debated in Geneva Also in Geneva the UN special envoy was due to hold the first round of consultation talks on peace in Yemen last week The Houthi delegation failed to turn up citing claims that they were not guaranteed safe return to Yemen once the talks were finished Geneva has the potential to be a major step forward for a peaceful resolution to the conflict Martin Griffiths the UN special envoy has said that this latest impasse does not mean that the talks are dead and he is visiting Sana a to meet Houthi leaders to agree a new timetable for talks

I will happily respond to both points Under the Bill data must be deleted unless there are legitimate grounds for retaining it The details of what is meant by legitimate grounds will be set out in recitals and then guidance from the Information Commissioner This is one area in which the right to be forgotten which has been long dreamt of and thought about is now being legislated for and the precise details of where it applies will be set out in guidance as the Bill states only that there need to be legitimate grounds for retaining data

The point is that the landlords employers and businesses would still be guilty of the same offence as they would now except that the tools at the disposal of the judge would be wider so he or she could impose a heavier sentence He or she could also decide not to impose a heavier sentence because of the ignorance of the employer landlord or business The sentences are not mandatory they are optional

My hon Friend is right The hon and learned Gentleman has not thought through the real life consequences Although one can create a great superstructure in theory how people react to it might be very different Some 5 6 billion of the unused tax relief relates to the high rate taxpayers who are likely to have substantial sums in other forms of savings and investment big houses for example If only a small proportion of those savings were switched into pension schemes the public cost of the pension scheme tax reliefs could rise by hundreds of millions of pounds each year with the benefit going only to wealthy pensioners That would inevitably raise the question whether we should continue with higher tax relief for pension contributions The only way in which the circle could be squared would I suspect be by abolishing higher rate tax relief That would create far more problems than the hon and learned Gentleman s proposals could possibly solve Although there could be tax charges many years down the line when the funds finally revert to the member s estate on death there would be significant cash flow problems for the Exchequer Little if any of that extra up front Exchequer cost would benefit the majority of people with modest pension funds who hold only limited amounts in other forms of savings Pensions should not become a tax favoured savings vehicle for non pension purposes Tax privileged pensions savings must be used to provide retirement income for life from no later than 75 For those with personal pension schemes the most financially efficient way of achieving that is to buy an annuity That is because annuities pool people s risks and ensure that they continue to receive an income from savings no matter how long they live even if they have the great longevity of the father of my hon Friend the Member for Battersea Martin Linton and I hope my hon Friend in due course The press release issued by the hon and learned Gentleman also covers what happens on death It states On death the capital sum rather than going into the pensioner s estate for distribution under his her will is returned to the annuity provider That simplifies the true position to such an extent that it is just plain wrong Any money that is left over becomes part of the overall pooling arrangement So if someone dies early the money goes back to the annuity provider for redistribution to people like my hon Friend s father It is a case of swings and roundabouts The moment we begin to interfere with that we start to undermine the whole system of pension funding in this country The hon and learned Gentleman has come up with little more than a sophisticated inheritance tax avoidance scam The proposals underlying aim is to allow access to a fund that is not used in order to secure the minimum pension or to stockpile it for inheritance by heirs The majority of people have pension funds way below the amount needed to provide the minimum income and would not benefit from the Bill s proposals It would be elitist in effect allowing the affluent to build up tax privileged bequests in addition to providing a retirement income That is not the purpose for which the pension tax reliefs which are to become even more generous are given Research by the ABI on reasons for delaying the purchase of annuity funds found that only 1 per cent of those who deferred cited inheritance motivations as a reason for delay That suggests that the problem of inheritance is not widespread but confined to a relatively small number of extremely wealthy people Having said that it is an understandable concern that the funds used to buy an annuity could be completely lost on early death That is addressed in the Inland Revenue s simplification review which includes the proposal that pensions that start before age 75 the vast majority begin many years earlier will be value protected In the case of an annuity the death of an annuitant before 75 would subject to a tax charge return the difference between the original purchase price and the total of annuity payments made before death The Government have produced sensible alternative proposals which is another reason why the Bill is inappropriate I am sure that you Mr Deputy Speaker have had the opportunity of reading their proposals on simplifying the taxation of pensions in the Treasury document published at the same time as the pensions Green Paper I am equally sure that the hon and learned Gentleman has failed to read it because if he had either he would have drafted his Bill differently or he would have given it up entirely When coupled with the Green Paper the document proposes a series of important changes to the tax regime and future pension provision which will completely change the pensions landscape

I accept that the ombudsman s report on tax credits used that phrase but it did not say that the tax credits system was in general disarray The hon Gentleman constantly makes that suggestion but given the scale of the undertaking the system has been broadly successful He encourages me to write off all overpayments but I am not prepared to do so Of course some will be written off or people will be unable to pay the money back but HMRC s duty is to seek recovery where that is possible However we have made the position perfectly clear as regards errors made by HMRC

I will do so very promptly Madam Deputy Speaker New clause 1 would require the Government to publish within three months of Royal Assent an assessment of the benefits of this scheme to parents of three and four year old children together with an assessment of the benefits in addition to the likely benefits of funding 25 hours of free child care per week for such parents The Government fully understand the importance of high quality early education for that age group which is why they fund 15 hours a week of early education for every three or four year old We have extended that entitlement to the least advantaged 40 of two year olds thus saving their families about 2 440 a year By the end of this financial year funding for early education places alone will have risen by over 1 billion during the current Parliament We have committed ourselves to that substantial investment in early education because there is overwhelming evidence here and elsewhere in the world that high quality early education has long lasting benefits for children We have seen big year on year improvements in the development of five year old children who have benefited from early learning although we recognise that many factors influence school readiness and later attainment We have commissioned academically robust and detailed research in order to understand more about the way in which high quality early education affects children s attainment and social and behavioural development However it is important to recognise as the Bill does that the cost of child care is an issue not just for under fives but for school age children For many working families the high costs of child care make it one of the largest parts of the household budget The Government believe that there is a powerful case for improving access to child care throughout childhood and to ensure that parents are helped to work if they choose to do so The new scheme for children up to the age of 12 will build on the 5 billion per year that the Government already spend on early education and child care It will help many more parents to meet their costs including self employed parents who cannot gain access to support under the existing employer supported child care scheme We recognise that every family is different and will have different child care needs and cost We recognise that no one size fits all The scheme is therefore designed to provide flexible support for working families and to cater for different family circumstances For example it will allow parents to build up money in their child care accounts to cover increased costs at holiday times As I have already said many times during our debates on the Bill the Government have made a clear commitment to reviewing the impact of the scheme two years after its full implementation That was made clear in the impact assessment that was published alongside the Bill The review will consider the impact on all age groups within the scope of the scheme which will of course include three and four year olds but it will not consider the effects of free early education which is already the subject of extensive evaluation The Government take the evaluation of early education very seriously We have commissioned a significant longitudinal study of early education and development which will evaluate the effectiveness of the current early education model in England and more specifically the impact of funded early years education on two year olds from lower income families It will also update evidence from the effective pre school and primary education project It will continue until 2020 The hon Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North Catherine McKinnell made a number of points For instance she mentioned children s centres Let me reiterate that the Government want to see a strong network of children s centres throughout the country offering families access to a wide range of local and flexible services tackling disadvantage and preparing children for later life Again we covered in Committee many of the points about what goes on in centres and support in children s centres The hon Lady also specifically mentioned supply side provision of child care which we touched on in Committee too There are 100 000 more child care places than there were in 2009 and a lot of work is being done on the supply side provision of child care which is the point of this Bill On the quality side we are providing 50 million in extra funding in 2015 16 to nurseries schools and other providers of Government funded early education to support disadvantaged three and four year olds This is also about improving quality as well as quantity and improving qualifications for the early years work force and introducing early years educator qualifications are vital We have discussed that too The hon Lady made a point about the overall support for child care and those on lower incomes The overall system of child care support remains focused on those on lower incomes The Government are already spending over 1 billion a year on child care support through tax credits and will extend this support in universal credit Under UC this Government are investing an additional 400 million so that families can claim up to 85 off the costs of child care from 2016 and 200 million is also being put in so that child care support will be available regardless of the number of hours worked The hon Lady mentioned the impact assessment and the average increase in tax free child care being 600 On average this increase in support is 600 but the average award will be higher because that is an average figure The hon Lady also mentioned access to the internet for families for 200 000 families and I would like to bring some clarity on this point The newspaper stories that appeared yesterday were inaccurate because what was reported is simply not fully the case they distort the situation As outlined in the letter circulated to Members of Parliament there will be assisted approaches for families who cannot access the internet which will make sure that no parent misses out We do recognise that some parents will have difficulty accessing or using the internet and in such cases Her Majesty s Revenue and Customs will support them to register and use their child care account online providing opportunities for learning and where appropriate encouraging parents to use online services independently in future I touched on this in Committee the HMRC support is very specific and the support will be there I want to make that clear so no Members leave the House tonight thinking there is no support for those families Where parents are simply not able to access the internet there will be facilities for them to access the scheme by telephone That point was also made previously We also touched extensively in Committee on the point about the system being too complex I want to assure all Members that this scheme is designed with parents in mind It is intended to be streamlined in its application and very straightforward simple flexible and convenient for parents As I said in Committee we are working with parents and many stakeholder groups including many who gave evidence in Committee and those we have been working with on the design of this scheme to ensure that their suggestions advice counsel and guidance are taken on board This is not meant to be a complex scheme It is meant to be as user friendly for parents as possible which is why we are listening and consulting because it is all about the design and making sure that those who need to access the scheme can do so

Further to the question asked by the hon Member for Sittingbourne and Sheppey Gordon Henderson Warm Front was in my view undermined by the extortionate charges of a small cartel of suppliers Given that only 22 companies are so far among the providers for the green deal can the Minister assure us that local fitters and local suppliers can be part of the programme so that costs are competitive

I think I followed that question The hon Gentleman is an expert in this area and his points are important I said in my statement that there will be operation expenses reopeners at 15 years and 25 years but they will be symmetrical so if operation costs have reduced the strike price will come down and if they have increased and that can be proven the strike price will go up That is the only way to manage such a contract over such a long period otherwise the initial strike price would have to be much higher in order for the investors to undertake those risks We will be transparent so over the coming weeks and months the hon Gentleman and the Select Committee will be able to look in detail at many of the issues he has raised

I think that the Minister is making excellent progress and I hope that my question will help My concern with the Bill is about local democracy On smaller district councils the cabinet system has already excluded an awful lot of councillors I fear that the Bill will alienate councillors and separate them from officials Officials will get much more power and become more involved in planning decisions at the expense of local democracy and the councillors Will the Minister confirm that that is not the case

My hon Friend is absolutely correct It is important that we have quality apprenticeships to ensure that they lead to proper jobs I commend my hon Friend I am sure his input has gone a long way towards insuring that increase in apprenticeship numbers over the past year Further support can be offered through an increase in the funding support for apprentice work placements to cover non productive employer costs such as travel accommodation and supervision I have spoken to employers in my constituency and found that another area where it is widely felt that greater Government support is necessary I put this to the Minister is in the current 50 reduction in funding for apprentices over the age of 18 an issue raised earlier by my hon Friend the Member for Stevenage Stephen McPartland Many firms and establishments do not allow workers under the age of 18 to enter their sites owing to the perceived high risk nature of the work which in turn limits the age of apprentices that companies will take on If the age were raised to 19 before the drop in funding it would encourage more employers to take on younger apprentices without the risk of not being able to utilise their skills fully on site An advanced economy needs people with advanced skills in order to grow and we need to use all our talents I am assured that this Government are committed to driving up the skill levels of the work force Apprenticeships already make a tremendous contribution to society but this Government intend and need to go further The Government should ensure that apprenticeships are improved and expanded so that more individuals and businesses can benefit from the opportunities that they offer

I thank the hon Gentleman for his comments and for his diligent support for the Bill Under the expert legal guidance of Lord Mackay of Clashfern we tried hard to find an all encompassing definition of all embryos that were not pure embryos Indeed the Academy of Medical Sciences tried to do so too Unfortunately we failed To return to the hon Gentleman s point however we should not give up before the Bill becomes law it is important that we have a much clearer definition of what we are talking about However I am content with the descriptions in the Bill relating to admixed hybrid embryos The 1990 Act has stood the test of time We have heard many tributes to the right hon and learned Member for Rushcliffe Mr Clarke and the then Conservative Administration for taking the Act through Parliament we owe a huge debt of gratitude too to Baroness Warnock They and the House showed faith in our clinicians our scientists and our regulators and that faith has been rewarded The challenge for us as the Bill goes through is to be equally bold and trusting always bearing in mind the wise words of Lady Warnock The law must not outrage the feelings of too many people but it cannot reflect the feelings of them all It must therefore be drawn with a view to the common good In essence despite the opposition of some people to the Bill the measure does little more than bring within the law and within regulation interpretations of the Act made by the HFEA changes in society and breakthroughs in medical science since 1990 In considering the Bill and possible amendments I draw the attention of Members to the three Select Committee reports tagged to the measure the Government proposals for the regulation of hybrid and chimera embryos produced by the Science and Technology Committee the Joint Committee report and the report Scientific Developments Relating to the Abortion Act 1967 I suspect there will be many amendments on abortion The first of those reports followed the White Paper produced by the Department of Health in December 2006 which proposed the prohibition of the creation of animal human chimera or hybrid embryos The White Paper coincided with applications from Newcastle and King s to create human animal cytoplasmic hybrid embryos both of which were granted under the 1990 legislation but need to be brought under the Bill The Science and Technology Committee concluded unanimously that the Government s proposed policy was wrong We found that there was a pressing need to clarify the law in relation to hybrid embryos and that research allowing the creation of human animal chimera or hybrid embryos was necessary and desirable We concluded that such research had the potential to contribute to the development of greater understanding of the genetic basis of diseases and of stem cell technology However the important point is that we did not say that it was the only viable form of research to develop stem cells We did not say that and I cannot recall that any serious group of scientists or politicians has made such a claim The Committee recognised as did the scientists and patient groups we met that research into adult stem cells and research into cord blood stem cells were of equal importance it was not one or the other Earlier the hon Member for Buckingham John Bercow made that point in his usual brilliant way The same point applies to the newly developed technology of induced pluripotent stem cells in Japan and the United States The hon Member for Bolton South East Dr Iddon is no longer in the Chamber He made the telling point that if we tried to bring adult stem cells back to pluripotency we would unleash all sorts of other things whose genetic trends are unknown It is important that no avenue of possible scientific advancement that could bring relief to people suffering hugely debilitating conditions should be outlawed or limited Regulated yes outlawed no

The whole House will be grateful to the hon Member for East Lothian Fiona O Donnell for initiating this debate on protecting children in conflict She was right to deal with the Palestinian situation but I will not follow her example in any detail as I do not want to get involved in the debate about the rights and wrongs of the Palestinian issue except for noting the suffering of both the Palestinian people and the Israeli people in a very difficult conflict I want to make some general remarks about how the British Government could try to improve the protection of children in conflict areas particularly when it comes to education Education is the subject on which I want to focus and I would be grateful if the Minister could deal with that problem when he replies I should perhaps declare a family interest I am speaking today because both my elder daughters work for charities in Africa and have worked in Kenya Rwanda the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Central African Republic They keep me informed of their work and what is going on and a few years ago I visited the Congo with War Child to look at the appalling privations that children faced particularly because of the conflict and the use of child soldiers My visit had a deep impact on me and I am sure that even despite all the excellent work of my hon Friend the Minister and other Ministers in the FCO and DFID there is still more that we can do As I say I want to concentrate on education but why are children particularly vulnerable It is an obvious point but they are vulnerable because they are young When a three year old loses their parents in a bomb attack it is virtually impossible for them to survive alone If a 25 year old loses a parent it is a tragedy but they can survive It is right that the House should focus particularly on the appalling impact of conflict on children which is much greater than its impact on mature people Of course children suffer appalling and severe trauma from witnessing events They do not have the life experience or emotional maturity to integrate a particular scene into the rest of their life We have been brought up in a very comfortable environment but we all know how even quite small events from our childhood can have a traumatic effect later on Imagine a child in a conflict situation witnessing their mother being raped or their brother being dragged off as a child soldier or witnessing murders or the appalling scenes that have happened in Syria That trauma will live with those children for ever Children are targeted in conflict situations for sexual attacks Girls and boys make up more than half the rape cases in such conflicts and that is an appalling statistic Imagine the appalling emotional trauma of that Children are also targeted by military groups that are keen to expand their ranks quickly and we have seen that in particular over the years in Congo As I know from my visit to the Congo and as we all know it is appalling to talk to former child soldiers who have been dragged into these events They have committed terrible things and terrible things have happened to them sometimes when they are just 13 or 14 years old War destroys livelihoods and children are often seen as a way for distressed families to get income Girls can be married early for a price or used as sex workers and boys can be sent out to work in fields and factories or to collect rubbish from the streets I occasionally visit the middle east and we see the desperate struggle for survival particularly for Syrian refugees in Lebanon or Jordan when there is no social security available to any significant extent In conflict situations families are desperate to survive and we all know that children have to be used as part of that The point I want to stress and focus on for the rest of my speech is that it is children and not adults who lose their opportunity for education Once that opportunity is lost it is lost for ever and can never be repeated Education is essential for children and particularly for children in conflict areas It is a life chance that comes only once and a reasonable level of education is even more important for children who will be expected to build a peaceful recovery from conflict Education keeps children safe Obviously if a child is in a school or in an educational environment it is less likely that they will be married early raped abducted or recruited by armed groups All that is much more unlikely when schools are open Actually education is prioritised by families in conflict areas We have seen on television such as during the Iraq conflicts and from our own experience how families that are often desperate and have nothing owning nothing surviving on nothing still make the effort to dress their children in immaculate uniforms to walk through bombed out streets to get school Education is extraordinarily important for them

No I do not accept that Almost four out of five bus services are provided commercially as opposed to being subsidised by local councils So far there have been no cuts at all to support from central Government for those services The BSOG bus service operators grant cut will come in next April The performance of local authorities up and down the country is very varied If she looks at East Riding which is not very far from her she will find that the Beeching cuts to which she refers are certainly not occurring there or in many other councils Many councils are protecting bus services some are not

I am glad that the Government have finally allowed us to debate this matter the motion and the amendment have been on the Order Paper since 23 November I have raised the failure to resolve the matter in business questions as have other hon Members Until today there has been no certainty about the dates for discussing private Members Bills Again the Government seemed to expect that they could assume Members support when they timetabled House business When opposition was expressed in the form of an amendment which my hon Friend the Member for Wellingborough Mr Bone tabled the Government assumed that they could get the motion through on the nod at the end of the day s business rather than allowing proper discussion which we are now having That is not right and it has been raised in the report which my hon Friend mentioned about allowing the House more control over its business Under the Wright scenario I suspect that we would not have had the problems that my hon Friend described However that is a debate for another day together with whether we move private Members Bills from Fridays to Wednesdays I commend my hon Friend s defence of private Members Bills which was made with no self interest because I am afraid that he was not successful in the ballot It is important that the House jealously protects private Members time I say that as someone who was successful in the ballot in 1997 when my main problem was not time but Eric Forth Getting the Bill round him was the major task and indeed we did that Of course I sympathise with my hon Friend s desire to maximise the number of days for private Members Bills However the Government s proposal to act pro rata and move to a lower number to reflect the shorter Session is right As the Deputy Leader of the House said it is in line with previous practice My hon Friend made several compelling points some more compelling than others However one of his more compelling points was that in a shorter Session the number of days decreases but in a longer Session the number does not increase The House may want to revert to that in the context of the Wright debate and allocating the future business of the House

Will my right hon Friend acknowledge that there are millions of trade unionists who have not gone on strike today a third of whom vote Conservative I ask him to tread very carefully in regard to getting rid of the majority principle I accept that it is important to have annual or regular ballots as he has described but if a law were brought in to remove the majority principle it could have implications for other organisations and institutions

The 3 000 figure was proposed by Save the Children at a time when it thought that 26 000 children in Europe were alone We now know that the figure is much higher and that 95 000 children are alone and at risk across Europe It would be for the Government to work with agencies such as Save the Children to establish the criteria I think that priority should be given to those with families in Britain who can care for them but that is something that we can debate It is right for us to do our bit to help Children are sleeping rough tonight because countries across Europe simply do not have the capacity to provide that help According to UNICEF and Save the Children 2 000 children are alone in northern Greece but there are fewer than 500 places for them and those places are full In Italy the agencies found that girls were being exploited by older men and that half the boys already had sexually transmitted diseases In Calais I met 11 and 12 year olds who were suffering from scabies and bronchitis and who were sleeping in tents with adult men This is the challenge that Europe faces teenage girls being trafficked into prostitution teenage boys being abused and raped children with hypothermia and pneumonia children who are traumatised because they have lost family along the way and children who are locked up in detention centres because there are no other places for them to go to again often alongside adult men A Syrian teenager who came to Parliament last week to meet Alf Dubs told me that he had fled the violence and fighting to reach family members who were here in Britain but the abuse and the suffering that he saw and experienced as a refugee alone in Europe were worse than the violence that he had left behind

May I say what a pleasure it is to follow the hon Member for Leeds North West Greg Mulholland I am a sentimental sort of bloke and I rather think we need to have the Liberal voice heard in this place I observe that there is not a single Liberal in what used to be the Lib Dem heartland of the south west but I am pleased that the hon Gentleman has been returned and I look forward to his contributions in the months and years ahead It is a particular pleasure to follow the maiden speech of my hon Friend the Member for North East Hampshire Mr Jayawardena who spoke exceptionally well He is the new James Arbuthnot which are very big shoes to fill We have spoken a lot today about the northern powerhouse We need also to speak about the west country powerhouse I confess my interest as a rural rustic from the south west I note that in recent years the Government have invested heavily in infrastructure in my part of the world and I look forward to their continuing to do so I am thinking in particular of the upgrading of the A303 which is vital for prosperity in the west country and of investment in superfast broadband which is clearly necessary for the rural businesses that my right hon Friend the Secretary of State for Business Innovation and Skills is particularly keen to promote While considering the Cities and Local Government Devolution Bill we should be a little careful I know that it would not be the Government s intention to disadvantage the shire counties in any way but it is vital that we get the balance right and do not inadvertently disinvest in rural parts of our country because of our understandable enthusiasm for investing in our great cities We have heard today about local enterprise partnerships and regional development agencies In my part of the world the transformation following the introduction of LEPs and the abolition of RDAs has been huge We have to admire the Opposition s nerve in tabling an amendment attacking the Government s record on housing never was there a better opportunity for a political party to draw a discreet veil In supporting the aspiration for low cost housing laid out in the Queen s Speech I make a plea for the integrity of the core planning process that lies at the heart of the Localism Act 2011 In Warminster which I represent residents feel with good cause that they are being taken for a ride the Minister for Housing and Planning knows that very well as I have been to see him about the issue recently I do not want public money or my constituents time to be wasted on core strategies that turn out to be worthless I do want the right housing to be in the right place with the right level of supporting infrastructure The late Charles Kennedy suggested that this Parliament would be about two Unions the United Kingdom and the European Union I very much welcome the inclusion of the European Union Referendum Bill in the Queen s Speech and I look forward to its Second Reading next week Devolution and subsidiarity must mean removing powers from Brussels as well My right hon Friend the Prime Minister is an operator I am sure he will return from Europe like Moses from Mount Sinai with a prospectus that I can recommend to my constituents They would expect a British exception that will exclude the UK from ever closer union which has only one destination union They will expect parity of esteem among EU currencies and the reaffirmation of the trading and commercial deal that my constituents their parents and grandparents thought that they were signing up to in 1975 My constituency has a heavy defence interest I declare my own interest as an ex regular and current reservist I welcome with due trepidation the inclusion of the strategic defence and security review in the Gracious Speech During the general election campaign many of my constituents expressed puzzlement at the fact that we have committed to statute the OECD 0 7 of GDP development target without having committed to NATO s 2 defence target notwithstanding the progress made last year at Celtic Manor They are also puzzled at the licence given to our unequal partners who enjoy NATO s fully comprehensive cover while paying a third party premium There can be no development without economic prosperity and there will be no prosperity without security The engineers of that security Britain s soldiers sailors and airmen are a distinct force for good in a troubled world Despite the progress made by the coalition Government the link between outcome and input in Britain s international development effort since 1997 has been far less clearcut If a country s military deploys to a country whose inhabitants pose little direct threat it operates in a space between altruism and enlightened self interest Britain s military contribution to making the world a better and safer place must be properly referenced in the upcoming SDSR and in our development returns

I thank my hon Friend for raising that issue The persistency of an offence is a factor that should be taken into account when looking at the seriousness of it Perhaps I can attempt to give the hon Member for Walthamstow some indication on these matters My hon Friend raises the issue of someone persistently undertaking the offence of stalking and we hope to reach a situation in which early examples or early behaviour of stalking can be identified captured and therefore dealt with through the lower level offence before it moves on to stalking behaviour the more serious offence that is set out in proposed section 4A We do take stalking very seriously however and we are determined to do all we can to stamp it out We have created the two new offences explicitly putting stalking on the statute book for the first time we are giving the police the powers of entry that they need to disrupt stalkers at an early stage and we have responded to the concerns of victims and of victims organisations by making it clear that behaviour which ruins lives will be properly punished I think that those changes will make a real difference to the lives of victims and I commend the Lords amendments and the Government s amendments to those amendments to the House

My hon Friend is absolutely right and it is very sad when people gain pleasure from using these rifles that the Government want to effectively ban them The muzzle energy will effectively mean a ban on the 5 calibre The only reason the Government are banning them is that they happen to be one of the largest calibres The police and the other authorities are saying that because they are so large they must be dangerous I have to tell the House that any rifle is dangerous in the wrong hands and used in the wrong way A 22 the very smallest rifle is lethal at over a mile if it is fired straight at somebody All rifles need to be handled with great care and held in very secure conditions In summing up the Government will I think cite some evidence as to why these rifles need to be banned They will cite the one that was stolen and chucked over the hedge with the barrel chopped off they will cite the fact that one was used in the troubles in Northern Ireland and they will cite the fact that more high powered weapons are being seized by customs at our borders But this has nothing to do with 5 calibre weapons It has everything to do with illegal weapons the sort of weapons of choice that sadly the criminal and the terrorist will use but not these particular weapons

Despite the recent funding the levels of work allowances have still not recovered from the cruel cuts made to them back in 2015 Does the Secretary of State recognise that although the principle of simplicity behind universal credit is a good one if universal credit is to have credibility it needs to be funded properly

It depends if there was an extension of competences then yes of course Coming back to the areas where those now on the Opposition Benches have promised referendums we have to look at what drives first the promise of a referendum and then the withdrawal of that promise Back in 1997 the only reason this country was promised a referendum on the euro was that the Referendum party stood for election posing a threat to the then Conservative Government and the Labour party For that reason both parties promised a referendum As it turned out that promise was the only thing that kept this country out of the euro What did we have after 1997 in the first few years of the Labour Government We had years and years of speculation about whether there would be a referendum I can remember working on the anti euro campaign and looking at what the media were saying There were dozens and dozens of stories we added them up that opened with the line In the strongest signal yet that Britain is going to join the euro Tony Blair has signalled that a referendum is just round the corner Let us remember all the acres of coverage and the huge sum of money that was spent analysing those five so called tests when all along they were simply a political fig leaf Then we had the European constitution A referendum on it was promised but for no other reason than the political interests of the Labour party Labour was concerned about the threat to its position in the 2004 Euro elections and for that reason that is simply for tactical self interested reasons promised a referendum out of the blue Having got those elections out of the way and having won in 2005 Labour then withdrew the offer of a referendum on the EU constitution and the Lisbon treaty We were then subjected to a further couple of years of endless talk about Tony Blair s red lines and what the Government were doing to protect the national interest with endless speeches trying to explain why the Lisbon treaty was not the same as the EU constitution when to all intents and purposes it was Throughout all that the decision on whether to hold a referendum on those issues was dictated by political interest and calculation and we need to move on from that Countries such as Ireland have done this much better than we have How sad it is that all too often we have had to rely on the people of the Irish Republic to stand up for the interests of European people Why have we not been able to hold referendums as automatically as they have been held in Ireland

The Government recognise that there is more work to do on raising awareness of conditions such as endometriosis and ensuring that clinical guidance is being followed and that therefore diagnosis is earlier It is essential that all of us Government Parliament employers the NHS and wider society do what we can to improve the diagnosis and more generally get rid of old fashioned taboos relating to women s health to ensure that people are treated fairly in the workplace and have their rights in law upheld and enforced A debate on the Adjournment or in Westminster Hall would be a good way of giving this important issue further attention

I am going to carry on and make a little progress If the Deputy Prime Minister is not going to sell out the principles of the NHS like he has the principles of his party he must toughen the tests for the Bill and help stop the market free for all in the Government s plans If he and his party mean what they say they can start today by backing us and backing the motion It calls on the Government to drop the damaging and unjustified market based approach exactly as the Liberal Democrat spring conference did and to uphold the Coalition Agreement promise to stop the top down reorganisations of the NHS which have got in the way of patient care There is no mandate for this the biggest reorganisation in NHS history either from the general election or from the coalition agreement

Forgive me but I am not going to give way I have just three or four minutes left The fact that the senior general the ruler of Burma will not even pick up the phone to speak to the Secretary General of the UN highlights the way in which the Burmese regime runs rings round the UN time and time again We saw that from the way it played Ibrahim Gambari in discussions about political reform in Burma We should be cautious about the amount of optimism we invest in UN processes My hon Friend the Member for Banbury rightly highlighted the need for serious reform of international processes and institutions with regard to how we respond to such disasters Mention has been made of the role that the Association of South East Asian Nations can play It is easy to knock ASEAN it did not behave as quickly as we would have liked and often dealing with it is a case of two steps forward one step back or one step forward and two steps back That was certainly the case at the end of last year when many of us were initially optimistic that ASEAN would take a strong position on the political situation in Burma and the crackdown on democracy protestors but in the end we were all slightly disappointed by the relatively weak stand that it took However ASEAN is important and it is trying to assemble a mercy coalition to play some sort of effective role in the humanitarian effort in Burma Rather than be critical of that it is incumbent on Ministers and the Department to see what assistance they can provide to the ASEAN effort The Secretary of State s Department is recognised as top of the class of governmental international aid Departments and he should look at the assistance and advice that his Department can give to ASEAN s aid efforts We want to see ASEAN play a much more productive and constructive role in Burma s affairs and this disaster perhaps provides an opportunity for it to do so I will not go into the responsibility to protect which numerous other speakers have covered Genocide has been mentioned by the hon Member for Ilford South Mike Gapes and my hon Friend the Member for Ribble Valley Mr Evans In the early days of the disaster last week even Liberal Democrat Front Benchers were talking about genocide in the context of the regime s initial response Genocide had been talked about in connection with the Burmese regime long before the disaster struck Back in June 2006 the hon Member for Cardiff North Julie Morgan tabled a question asking the Minister responsible at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office whether the Burmese regime s acts against the ethnic peoples there amounted to genocide On that occasion the Government did not take a definite position In October 2006 my hon Friend the Member for Buckingham John Bercow tabled a similar question again asking whether the actions of the regime in Burma amounted to genocide or an intent to commit genocide Again the Minister concerned did not quite take a clear position Many of us hold the view that the behaviour of the regime in recent years amounts to genocide and a clear intention to commit genocide The regime has strong genocidal tendencies as has been demonstrated again in recent days We cannot quite neatly separate the humanitarian issues from the political issues when we talk about the disaster in Burma of the past seven days They are bundled up together Indeed I am delighted that the Under Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs is sitting on the Front Bench this afternoon because I know that she takes a deep personal interest in the issue Her presence serves as a reminder that the political issues are wrapped up with the international development issues Our hope is that we get a more effective and systematic humanitarian effort up and running The aid getting through is nothing like enough to bring relief to the people of Burma However there is a bigger hope beyond that that the tragic events of the past week will somehow lead to a new outlook particularly on the part of the younger generation of Burmese rulers who will come through when that group of ageing corrupt and abhorrent generals finally has its day As has been the case in other parts of the world disasters have led to political reform My hope is that once we get through the immediate humanitarian response there will be a political sea change in Burma

My hon Friend is absolutely right in drawing attention to the combination of tax credits which give enormous support to families particularly those with young children and the extra increases in child benefit child benefit was frozen under the Conservative Government which has risen by 25 per cent in real terms along with the minimum wage We did not merely introduce the minimum wage in the teeth of the opposition that was mounted by the Conservatives but increased it The combination of tax credits and the minimum wage is making work pay for people That is one of the reasons why we have 2 million extra people in work My hon Friend is absolutely right that there are families that benefit from tax credits as do pensioners Without them they would still be living in the poverty that they experienced under the Conservatives

May I start by agreeing with a major point made by the hon Member for Arundel and South Downs Mr Flight He said that the Paymaster General s opening remarks describing the performance of the British economy and its management under the Government were far too rosy I would say that they were Panglossian There may have been successes in the last five years particularly Bank of England independence and the increased stability that that has given to monetary policy which Liberal Democrats have welcomed on many occasions To suggest that the whole picture of the macro economy is rosy however is far from the truth I suggest to the Paymaster General that rather than simply reading the briefing from Treasury officials she should go to the House of Commons Library to read the latest research paper on economic indicators published this week Merely browsing through that will show her that a whole range of indicators are flashing red which the Government appear to be ignoring totally I was therefore very worried by the right hon Lady s speech Manufacturing output has fallen in the last five quarters Indeed in 2001 it fell by 2 3 per cent We can also consider other industries such as agriculture hunting and fishing whose output has of course been falling for many quarters it fell in 2000 and 2001 and it fell in the first quarter of this year Other industrial sectors show similar falls Manufacturing is perhaps the most worrying because of its importance to the tradeable sector We have seen large falls in that sector especially in manufacturing employment which fell in 1998 1999 2000 and 2001 and is falling again this year In fact manufacturing employment is falling at around 5 per cent a year while manufacturing output is falling at 6 per cent a year Can the Government be proud of that I remember that when the Chancellor of the Exchequer was in opposition in his role as shadow Chancellor and prior to that as the Opposition spokesman on trade and industry he was on the television night after night talking about manufacturing manufacturing investment manufacturing output and manufacturing jobs Under his stewardship however we have seen declines in all those areas He does not have a record of which to be proud

I accept that we need to improve the provision of mental health services for children but I do not accept the hon Lady s characterisation She will know that in the final Budget before the general election the previous coalition Government committed 1 25 billion over this Parliament to improving child mental health provision and perinatal mental health support That has been honoured by this Government and we are in the process of working out how to roll that out It is something that the Minister for Community and Social Care my right hon Friend the Member for North East Bedfordshire Alistair Burt spends a lot of time thinking about Before we discuss precisely what things need to happen I think they should be done in a bipartisan spirit we should recognise that really important progress has been made in recent years I want to start with some of the achievements made by the previous Labour Government who increased funding for the NHS and within that for mental health services They oversaw a significant expansion of the mental health workforce and big improvements in in patient care with 70 of mental health patients being seen in private rooms They increased the use of new drugs and therapies including psychotherapy Those were important steps forward Under the coalition Government in the previous Parliament we saw a record investment of 11 7 billion in mental health services at a time of huge pressure on public finances We passed the parity of esteem clause in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 something we Conservative Members are incredibly proud of The first access targets were set for talking therapies for psychosis We are starting to end the distortion that the right hon Member for North Norfolk talked about which saw targets for physical health access sucking resources away from local mental health provision over a sustained period We have seen particular progress in two areas It is important to mention them it provides encouragement that when we decide to focus on improving specific areas of mental health provision we can make real progress First on talking therapies the NHS is now recognised as a world leader The number of people getting help from talking therapies quadrupled from 182 000 people starting treatment in 2009 10 to 800 000 starting treatment last year The total number of people helped in the previous Parliament was 3 million compared to just 226 000 people helped in the Parliament before that a thirteenfold increase We are hitting the new access target to reach 15 of those needing it although we are not quite hitting the recovery target I hope we can put that right soon That model is being looked at very closely by Scandinavian countries and a pilot based on what we have done here is starting in Stockholm We can be very proud of that important progress The last Parliament saw a 50 increase in dementia diagnosis rates up from 41 at the start of the Parliament to 67 at the end of the Parliament the highest dementia diagnosis rate in the world We have 1 3 million dementia friends and 120 dementia friendly communities We have seen a doubling in funding for dementia research with a new ambition to find a cure or disease modifying therapy by 2025 In the spending round the Prime Minister announced funding for a new dementia research institute that will be another important step forward

I draw the House s attention to my outside interests among which are some financial interests in developing nations The scale of the development problem facing us is largely to do with the projected world population growth over the coming years so it is right that the CDC focus on Africa and south Asia as they are key areas of population growth Twenty African nations are posting fertility rates in excess of five children per woman and in some that figure is over seven Africa is predicted to account for 80 of world population growth quintupling its 1 2 billion population to add around 5 billion to the global population this century while the number of Africans aged 15 to 24 is expected to nearly double by 2050 to 452 million These facts present some of the most outstanding challenges of our time the impact on global warming which we heard about earlier environmental degradation the impact on biodiversity and access to resources and the potential consequences of war and migration all of which can also have a big impact here at home The only way to meet these immense challenges is to give people opportunities close to where they live and that is what the CDC is helping to deliver more job opportunities better education so that people can take advantage of those opportunities better health and reproductive care and the involvement of women in the workforce We should be helping other people to invest in these sorts of things The difference between the CDC and other kinds of aid is that these funds can be used to create businesses that can go on and have their own life and be recycled Yes some of the capital can come back to us for us to reinvest but more importantly these businesses can have a life of their own If they are doing something well they will be asked to do it again and again with their own capital personnel and creativity If we are to tackle these almost insurmountable challenges they have to have their own life The CDC can deliver that potential for scalability into the future and help us to cope with those challenges The CDC is also great because it presents an example of good governance and an opportunity for us to lead by example to inspire entrepreneurs to build capital and expertise in local markets and to develop companies and structures capable of stewarding their own capital into the future This is about building trust in the future in nations where often a pound tomorrow is worth a lot more than a pound in just a few years because they do not have the necessary confidence in local structures in the enforceability of contracts or in their politics If we can build that trust into the future through these methods we can help to create a virtuous circle that has a great impact This investment can also bring us opportunities in terms of commercial information and so on My right hon Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield Mr Mitchell made some great points about the way the CDC works and about some of the great people involved with it This is about creating human connections and using this country s abilities to help nations develop in a positive way to break down the barriers to development to tackle crony capitalism to reduce regulation taxes and subsidies and licences which often favour particular operators and to enable more rapid growth and greater flexibility in those economies That will also give stable politics a better chance in these places I will happily support the Bill and I commend it to the House

I thank the Secretary of State for Justice for his answer although he did not mention his Department s responsibility for the British Crown dependencies of the Isle of Man Jersey Guernsey Sark and Alderney He will know that the previous Government were rather negative towards the loyal subjects in the Crown dependencies Will he confirm that the new Conservative led Government will be positive towards them and value their contribution to the British economy

My hon Friend is exactly right I think there was an element of delusion in the country inasmuch as people believed that Labour could be trusted with the economy That was clearly not the case Older voters I speak to in my party association and more widely in Spelthorne remember the appalling legacy of the 1970s when exactly the same thing happened None of this is new we have seen it all before Exactly the same thing has happened 30 years later Labour came into power made all sorts of spending commitments with the best intentions but found that we had run out of money It was that simple On that note I urge the House to vote in favour of the Budget motions

My hon Friend is much skilled in these debates and I take his point entirely Time and again Government Members have challenged us to make clear what tax changes we would make to rebalance the unfairness in the tax system I am delighted therefore that the Labour Front Bench team has backed the Lib Dem policy of a mansion tax while going further by saying that the money could be used to fund a 10p tax rate which would bring immense benefit to the lowest paid in our communities It would be a tremendous boost to many of the lowest paid people across Teesside and the rest of the country including all the people who have landed one of these low paid part time jobs that the Government gleefully boast about Those people are to be praised and helped Their pay is derisory yet they want to work hard and be in a job so we should do something to help them They already face the prospect of a cut in income from the changes to tax credits from the end of this month and today the Lib Dems and others could join us in helping to correct that unfair tax change and recognising their commitment to hard work We need action to tackle the unfairness in the system to sort out the big six energy companies to stop the rip off rail fares condoned by the Government and to stop the poorest people the most vulnerable in our society being ripped off by payday loan companies and loan sharks Let more of those with the assets rather than those with none pay the taxes There is real poverty in our communities One illustration is the increasing number of food banks I will be opening another one on Monday at the New Life church in Billingham in my constituency We should not have to be doing such things We should not need food banks I know that their use increased even when we were in government but they should not be necessary If we had a fair income tax system we would not need food banks The mansion tax might mean 5 a week for some families That would not buy a small glass of wine in a Canary Wharf bar but it could make a huge difference to the people at the bottom of the earning scales It would buy enough bread from Asda for a family of four for several days yet the Tories and more shamefully the Lib Dems would miss the opportunity to put bread in the mouths of poor families by failing to send a message to the Chancellor that he should adopt this mansion tax in next week s Budget I am sure that people who own property worth more than 2 million could afford the extra charge to help the poor If not they can move to a less expensive property and dodge the tax Like my hon Friend the Member for Edinburgh East Sheila Gilmore I see a parallel with the bedroom tax Thousands of people in my area are facing a cut in their income The answer apparently is to move to a smaller property Those with homes valued at more than 2 million but who cannot afford a mansion tax should do what the poor have to do and downsize I am one of those who supports higher taxes particularly when people can afford to pay so I plead guilty as charged Earlier today a Minister said that the Government were focused on the causes of poverty but all the time cash is being shifted from the poorest to the wealthiest just as the funds available to local authorities in the north of England are being shifted to the richer areas in the south I said that unemployment was not falling in my constituency but in some parts of the south it has fallen albeit owing to part time low paid jobs The Government s austerity measures have devastated local authorities in the north east and the contractors who build roads and houses and promote and deliver other services are the losers being forced to pay off skilled workers who want to work and support their families Next Wednesday the Chancellor will deliver his Budget for 2013 14 It is probably his last chance before the general election in 2015 to come up with a set of policies that could make a real difference to people s lives The biggest difference he could make would be to abandon his plan A under which growth has stagnated unemployment in areas such as mine has grown and deficit and debt reduction has become even harder but we know he will not do it He is tied to his ruinous plan A because he has staked his credibility on it but there is no credibility in it The Tories still talk about what will happen if the economy turns around but if we return to growth will ordinary people suddenly stop feeling the strain of higher costs and less money in their pockets I very much doubt it This ignores the fact that the Chancellor s plan has already failed on its own terms Not only is the national debt far higher than it was when he took office but he has failed and failed again on growth The reason is that without a good level of growth it is difficult to reduce deficits and debt and as the Chancellor s own Office for Budget Responsibility pointed out last week cutting spending and hiking up taxes for ordinary people has slowed and stopped economic growth As the ratings agency Moody s pointed out when it downgraded the UK s credit rating the country s lack of growth has made it nearly impossible for the Government to meet the only real goal they set themselves which was eradicating the structural deficit Although a return to growth would be welcome only strong growth would be enough to make up for the lost years of economic stagnation under this Government and to keep up with the growing and ageing population Unless economic growth is above population growth we are all getting poorer Add to that the fact that the Government are redistributing from the bottom to the top by cutting the top rate of tax for millionaires while capping welfare increasing VAT and cutting public services and the scale of their failure becomes all the more apparent In Stockton North we know all too well the impact of the Government s policies Long term unemployment has more than doubled in the past 12 months and youth unemployment remains stubbornly high Next Wednesday the Chancellor has a chance to change course cut spending less quickly and focus on taxing obscene wealth in order to invest in young people He is very keen to point to the past and the failures as he sees it of the Labour Government but he has been in his role for nearly three years and has failed abysmally There will be much for a Labour Government to do in 2015 to address the unfairness built into our country by the Conservative Lib Dem alliance I have talked about energy rail fares and housing and we are already making clear some of the things we would do Today Government Members can help us get our fairness agenda under way by backing a mansion tax and helping to fund lower taxes for those who need them most I hope they will

Today marks the 12th anniversary of the tragic terrorist attack on New York s twin towers I am sure the whole House will wish to join me in sending our condolences to all those who were affected by that abhorrent attack including the families of the 67 British citizens who lost their lives These terrorists seek to divide us but they do not understand that their actions only make us more determined and more united in our resolve to defeat them This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others and in addition to my duties in the House I will have further such meetings later today

My hon Friend is right to stress the importance of the automotive industry to his constituency and I am well aware of it He is also right to say that what companies want is access to support as quickly as possible and we are endeavouring to achieve that We need to look at the issue on a case by case basis and there are certain due diligence steps that we will need to take because taxpayers money is involved the whole House would expect us to be responsible with it Having said that we need to move as speedily as we can in all these areas including access to the working capital scheme on which we are working actively with the banks at the moment

My hon Friend makes a good and pertinent point I will talk about that in more depth in a moment In Committee I sought support for several measures that would have forced the Government to be more transparent in their financial obligations to reconsider the funding package to local government and to clarify how they would interact financially with operators This afternoon I seek support for new clause 3 Let me set out some of the background to the new clause As all Members will appreciate council tax has doubled in the past 10 years and now constitutes a heavy burden for those on low and in many cases middle incomes

If there is a mistake and an overpayment the Treasury is obliged to try to claim that money back It would not be fair to the remaining taxpayers if that did not happen Let us be absolutely clear about the vast majority of the millions of families who have benefited from tax credits as a result of that That is why the incomes of the poorest 40 per cent of this population have gone up in percentage terms roughly double what they were in the previous 18 years It has made an immense difference to many families in this country We must all know of people in families in our own constituencies who as a result of the working tax credit have been able to go out and get a job The job has paid and they have been able to look after their families properly it has dramatically transformed their lives Yes it is true that we must make sure that we remove some of the problems within the system but tax credits have brought an enormous amount of social justice and benefit in this country overall

When we hear reports of that sort of course they are very alarming That is why the Department of Health makes sure that investigations do take place That may be undertaken by the Department of Health or by the particular trust involved the ambulance trust or the hospital These issues are properly investigated because we do not want to see this happening we do want to see people being properly cared for If there are lessons to be learned then they will be learned because our support for our NHS is about providing it with the funding the doctors the nurses the treatments and the capabilities that it needs in order to be able to deliver for patients That is why we are backing the NHS with more funding It is why we are ensuring that it gets the best treatments survival rates for cancer are higher than they have ever been before It is why we are ensuring that we have better joined up services across the NHS and social care so that people who do not need to go into hospital are able to be cared for at home And it is why we are ensuring that we are reducing waste in the NHS so that taxpayers money is spent as effectively as may be on patient care That is a plan for the NHS but it is a plan that puts patients first

I am grateful for the opportunity to speak briefly in the debate As I have mentioned I may not be able to observe all our conventions as I will shortly host an event for the Holocaust Educational Trust That may be pertinent as it is worth reminding the House that the UK has been in advance of many other nations in dealing with spoliation the unlawful taking of goods from the Jewish community during the second world war That issue has been handled well in this country which bodes well for how we will handle aspects of The Hague convention in the future One waits six years for a DCMS Bill and then like buses two come along at once I am pleased that I have been able to speak in debates on the Digital Economy Bill and this Bill I wanted this Bill for a long time as Minister When I was an Opposition spokesman I remember looking forward to its introduction by the Labour Government but it fell by the wayside as the election approached I argued vociferously for six years for the Bill but for some reason the Government s business managers did not see its importance I am glad that under the new Government they do understand how important it is Many officials have brought it to fruition but I wish to mention Hillary Bauer who originally brought the Bill forward So long has the process been that she has now retired Of all hon Members who have an interest I wish to pick out in particular my hon Friend the Member for Newark Robert Jenrick who has been vociferous about cultural protection He has engaged with me and my right hon Friend the Member for Maldon Mr Whittingdale about the issue I wish to draw the Minister s attention to three issues for when she sums up Having watched the video of her playing keepy uppy last week I know that her summing up will be something to behold First I hope that she will make it clear that our own troops will not be at risk under the convention The convention and the Bill make it clear that it is the intentional destruction of cultural property that comes within their scope something that our British troops could never be accused of doing They already act within the terms of the convention and indeed it is wonderful to hear that the Ministry of Defence is working with DCMS to set up a 21st century version of the monuments men made up of people from the Army reserves I would welcome any information the Minister has on progress regarding that point Secondly on the vexed question of clause 17 my understanding is that the convention has been in place in Germany for the last 10 years and I know of no cases in which art dealers have unwittingly been brought within its scope The legislation is clear there must be some degree of suspicion on the part of any dealer before they could possibly be brought within scope Given the noble profession of art and antiquities dealers in this country any dealer who had a suspicion that something had been looted or trafficked would immediately alert the authorities so dealers have nothing to fear from the Bill My third point is about the cultural protection fund which is close to my heart and something for which I campaigned as a Minister wholly unsuccessfully on the back of Neil MacGregor the then director of the British Museum He said to me early in my time as a Minister that the museum and many of our other national museums do extraordinary work in many jurisdictions to support the work of archaeologists and the preservation of antiquities My campaign was unsuccessful until my hon Friend the Member for Newark raised the issue I think the situation in Palmyra also changed the Chancellor s mind I am glad that the Department for International Development has I gather stumped up most of the money for the cultural protection fund It is deeply frustrating that the terms under which DFID operates the alleviation of poverty seem to preclude it helping out in these areas The fact remains that our national museums do this work all over the world and it seems to me wholly legitimate that international development funds should supporting the skilling up of people in developing countries in archaeological expertise as well as the preservation of their culture We should without doubt support that I urge the Minister and the Secretary of State to take the cultural protection fund as a starting point for the UK to become an international centre for the preservation of antiquities and the skilling up of archaeological schools around the world Members in the other place have suggested that we could become a repository a digital archive for some of the great treasures around the world as well as the centre for the blue shields I urge the Secretary of State to take that up Finally I cannot resist the bait from the Scottish National party spokesman the hon Member for Argyll and Bute Brendan O Hara He talks about the Elgin marbles I am afraid he does this great convention and the Bill a disservice by bringing up the Elgin marbles They were of course purchased legitimately in the 19th century Not only that they have been preserved to the very highest standards possible in the greatest museum in the world which as my hon Friend the Member for East Worthing and Shoreham Tim Loughton pointed out is a world museum that is open to all free of charge The Elgin marbles are seen in pristine condition by millions of people Indeed they were recently loaned to Russia for even more people to see which goes to show that the British Museum preserves the Elgin marbles not for any national self interest but for the world

I firmly recognise that the hon Gentleman is absolutely entitled to his point of view which I suggest to him is not one that is entirely shared across the House or across Northern Ireland None the less I respect the fact that his view is strongly and deeply held although I would beg to disagree with some of his remarks and conclusions It is clear to me that there is consensus in Northern Ireland on the need to deal with the past There is clear consensus among many on another issue to deal with issues of the past by public inquiries which may lead to some 200 million being spent on one inquiry deeply troubles not only this House rightly but many people in Northern Ireland who genuinely pose a question about whether the public interest is being served by the public inquiry The Eames Bradley group was right to address that issue and it put forward proposals which this House and those in Northern Ireland must now carefully consider

Thank you Mr Speaker for giving me the opportunity to speak this evening This is the second maiden speech today following the excellent contribution by my hon Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute Brendan O Hara May I take a moment to thank you Mr Speaker and your colleagues across the parliamentary estate for all the help and co operation that have been afforded to all the new SNP MPs since we were elected The SNP group has grown more than ninefold since the election causing something of a logistical headache for your colleagues Their efforts are hugely appreciated not least by those of us who have got lost around the parliamentary estate rather than politically As we have proudly pointed out we are wearing the white rose of Scotland we have no plans on Yorkshire just yet Members will be glad to learn that well over 40 of us are still in the Chamber As far as I am aware the Whips have not told me that we have any plans for a snap vote this evening so Members can all rest easy I would like to take the opportunity to refer to my predecessor the right honourable Sir Menzies Campbell who served the people of North East Fife with such enormous distinction over many years He is held in fond affection by people there I know that from my own experience I also know that he is held in fond affection by Members from across the Chamber not least of course the Liberal Members I know that Members across this House like my constituents and me will want to wish him every happiness and a fulfilling retirement He richly deserves it I am sure that Sir Menzies will not mind me saying that we do not agree on everything However we do agree that it is a huge privilege to serve the constituency of North East Fife It is a wonderful constituency and a diverse one running from the coast of Leven all the way to the old borough of Newburgh Within that wide and diverse constituency lies Scotland s oldest university founded in 1413 and still a centre of educational excellence In fact I know that there are Members from across the Chamber who have benefited from that education St Andrews remains an outstanding and ground breaking institution Indeed since the last Parliament was dissolved the university has announced it will be building a clean biomass facility in Guardbridge which will make it Europe s first carbon neutral university so it is still ground breaking 600 years on North East Fife is also home to some of our finest industries such as tourism As Members will be aware it is the home of golf It is also home to some of our finest food and drink industries In recent years the food and drink industry in Scotland has gone from strength to strength and credit should be given to Richard Lochhead and to the Scottish Government for their work on promoting that industry More importantly credit should also go to the entrepreneurs Food and drink from North East Fife is now a byword for excellence and quality It also provides the Chancellor will be pleased to learn significant exports and revenues Among other fine small businesses I have distilleries Members will all be pleased to learn at Kingsbarns Daftmill and Eden Mill I can assure Members of the excellence of those products Actually I hope that the House will consider stocking some of the produce from my constituency over the coming months and years There are plans for another distillery on the site of Lindores Abbey In fact one of the first references to whisky came in 1494 The Chancellor will again be pleased to learn that that was for an Exchequer roll I will keep Members informed of the quality of that product too It would be remiss of me not to mention the Queen s Speech after all that is what this debate is about I want to mention something that is important to communities across North East Fife the relationship with our European partners Today in the Queen s Speech we heard proposals about a referendum on our membership of the EU We on these Benches fully intend to make a positive case for Scotland s and the UK s continued membership of the EU and you will be pleased to learn Mr Speaker that we have some experience with referendums on these Benches The Scottish referendum regardless of whether people voted yes or no illustrated what happens when we have an open and positive debate It was an enriching experience for our democracy and everybody in Scotland That is why we want to look at a positive case and even look at some areas where we could deepen our relationship with our European partners Should we for instance be looking at greater co operation on foreign and security issues as has been mentioned by a number of Members The refugee crisis in the Mediterranean is an issue not just for Malta or Italy or Libya or Syria for that matter it is an issue for us all and I am delighted that Members from every party across this House have mentioned that We also need to build relationships with other countries not least on how we deal with the ongoing crisis in Ukraine and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union where I personally have a little professional background We should also be looking at working with our European partners in considering the challenges of and opportunities provided by tackling climate change and the benefits that a social Europe and a Europe that promotes a living wage and other benefits to its citizens can provide None of us on the SNP Benches is saying Europe does not need reforms The common fisheries policy has had a devastating impact on communities across my constituency in the East Neuk of Fife and elsewhere across Scotland as my colleagues will testify Similarly the expensive practice of moving the Parliament from Brussels to Strasbourg every month defies any logic in these times of straitened budgets The Scottish referendum provided many lessons most notably the case for making a positive budget and including as many of our citizens as possible in the debate about the future of our respective nations That leads me on to the important point of the franchise I think everyone would agree that extending the franchise in the Scottish referendum to 16 and 17 year olds and EU nationals living in Scotland was a good thing We are currently in a situation where nationals of Cyprus or Malta can vote in the upcoming referendum but not an MSP called Christian Allard who is a French national and who makes a significant contribution to our country A short time ago the hon Member for Norwich North Chloe Smith made a fine contribution in which she referred to low turnout among young people All Members have a responsibility to think about how we can engage young people in the political process I think a good place to start is votes for 16 year olds particularly in this referendum Why should those with the greatest investment in the future not have a say in that future We should be broadening things to include EU nationals and 16 year olds I strongly believe that it is the electorate who should make the decisions about the politicians and not the other way round with the politicians choosing the electorate A vibrant democracy should also be reflected in this House My colleagues comments have reflected the SNP s willingness to work with Members from all parties in furthering the aims on which we stood and in furthering democracy across the United Kingdom The Government may have a majority but we must remember that they returned only one MP from Scotland whereas the SNP returned 56 and I think they should be looking to work with us In Holyrood the SNP worked with parties across the Chamber and there is always scope to learn During the period of minority Administration from 2007 to 2011 the SNP worked well and nobody in this Chamber has greater experience of building alliances than my right hon Friend the Member for Gordon Alex Salmond No party not least our own has a monopoly on wisdom or good practice We would be the first party to recognise that The SNP recognised that fact during its time in government and we will recognise it during our time on these Benches as well Mr Speaker I should like to thank you for this opportunity to make my maiden speech but most of all I should like to thank the voters of North East Fife for giving me the enormous privilege of representing them for the next five years

The hon Gentleman makes a fair point on which I am happy to reassure him The motion endeavours to give effect to paragraphs 4 and 5 of the report I apologise to the House for the fact that giving effect to the dozen lines of those paragraphs requires so much legal jargon I explained to the hon Member for New Forest West that the motion contains a provision for the Standing Committee to recommend a different out date and that under the terms of the motion the Government must table that proposal within five sitting days The motion contains a further provision the Standing Committee will propose the length of the remaining stages and the allocation of time within that The hon Member for Macclesfield is right to say that the Programming Sub Committee that makes the recommendation to the Standing Committee will be chaired by the Chair of the Standing Committee That will bring an impartial and independent element to the discussion and he or she will be responsible for safeguarding the interests of the Opposition and Back Benchers I know that the Chairman of Ways and Means takes a particular interest in the important role of the Chairmen of Standing Committees in chairing the Programming Sub Committees

Actually there has been very little increase in growth in Switzerland There is no direct correlation and the evidence is weak As I have said previously and as a report that came out this week clearly indicated many different levers of economic growth are already in the hands of the Scottish Government but they have either chosen not to use them at all or when they have chosen to use them it has had a detrimental effect as well as sometimes having advantages

While I am always the first to welcome an improvement in performance I must tell my hon Friend that the performance of South Eastern Trains has improved by almost the same amount as that of the other south east operators It does not necessarily follow that the fact that the Strategic Rail Authority is currently running the franchise has led to the improvement it is also due to Network Rail s improved performance During the review I have made it clear that I consider the principle of both public and private participation in the industry to be important and beneficial Apart from anything else the private sector brings in almost as much money as the public sector Although Connex was undoubtedly a supreme example of a bad franchisee there are many good private sector operators and some are an awful lot better than British Rail was It is not necessarily the case that the private sector is bad and the public sector is good

The Bill is required It is almost 20 years since the 1990 Act The Bill ensures that the regulatory framework for assisted conception is brought up to date and its purpose clarified The Bill s second function is to maintain public confidence The subject of embryo research is complex and highly emotive and it is crucial that the public are kept on board I speak as a female who is infertile and who went through years of medical treatment sadly without the doctors ever discovering why I could not conceive naturally In Britain about 20 per cent of young women and couples go through the same experience They want a natural conception they hope that scientific advances will help them but in many cases those fail The Bill deals with a regulatory framework that is of the utmost importance As the chair of the all party parliamentary infertility group I want to put it on record that I see the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority as an excellent body It is highly professional it has a sound reputation and it is seen as authoritative Through its actions it protects patients monitors safety and efficiency reassures the public who are concerned about the manipulation of embryos and protects those working in the field It is a highly professional organisation which commands worldwide respect However I am concerned that the Government have not chosen to examine the way in which the regulations impact not just on research which is crucial and has been the subject of much debate today but on treatment I have previously pressed this case and failed but I suggest to the House that to license standard IVF procedure and treatments now is excessive I say that not because I think that there should be no inspection of course there should However the Healthcare Commission could investigate make judgments when appropriate and ensure effective service delivery Instead we have a system in which the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and the Healthcare Commission regulate We have been promised a lighter touch but frankly it is not appropriate at this stage for us to continue with the HFEA s regulation of treatments The licensing procedure often takes 18 months to deliver it is highly costly and takes a very long time Many of our clinics pay up to 70 000 a year to deliver the system to people who are diagnosed as having medical problems those people are the one group with such problems to whom we say Sorry but you have to pay for any hope of effective treatment I am disappointed that the situation has not changed My second concern is that the HFEA spends an inordinate amount of time deliberating over licences Those are complex research licences and nobody would deny the complexity that it tries to handle I am really pleased that under the Bill the HFEA will be able to engage a committee of experts to help it deliver an effective licence That is appropriate

I should like to conclude because I want the Minister to be able to explain in a way that he did not necessarily do in the first flush of debate on the topic in Westminster Hall and possibly reflect the views of the vast number of Conservative Members I am still perplexed that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury chose that McDonalds diploma analogy Perhaps he will reflect on that and recognise that some IFAs were slightly astounded by that reflection on their professional integrity He might want to choose his words more carefully It is important that parliamentary accountability should be voiced The more I reflect on these financial services policy issues the more it strikes me that there is a democratic deficit No we do not want to be embroiled in the day to day operational issues of regulation but policy is policy and we are accountable for that Perhaps as my hon Friend the Member for Leeds East Mr Mudie suggested we can return to the issue when we come to the FSA reform Bill and discuss amendments to that Hon Members will log and remember today s debate and we can come to that later on in the day It is a shame that there is no motion tonight on the issue It would have been useful for Members to express the formal position of the House of Commons on the matter This is a time for the Minister to listen to the debate and perhaps reflect carefully on the measured and worthwhile comments that have been made by hon Members across the Chamber

I will try my best to cut down my speech to five minutes To be fair I did secure a Westminster Hall debate on this subject on 6 January so the Minister has heard it all before but he will have to hear it again The situation in Scotland is far worse than in the rest of the UK and the situation in my constituency of East Ayrshire is far worse than anywhere else in Scotland I do not need to say any more to emphasise just how bad the situation is We have almost 20 square kilometres of disturbed and unrestored land which has been abandoned East Ayrshire council commissioned an independent assessment of the true cost of restoring the land and a cost of 160 million was identified for East Ayrshire Hargreaves estimated a cost in excess of 300 million for the whole of Scotland But the bond to carry out the restoration work in East Ayrshire totals just over 28 million and even that is not settled Clearly there is an enormous funding gap I have pressed the Government to return funding to Scotland from its contributions to the coal levy but that has not been forthcoming I am not aware of any other fund that is available but if my hon Friend the Member for Bridgend Mrs Moon is right and that money exists I would certainly support the idea of devolving it to the Scottish Government The Scottish Government have responsibility for this matter and they are not coming up with any money either so we have problems at both UK and Scottish level Any money that is available will pay for a greatly reduced quality of restoration That is why the proposal by Hargreaves for a technical change to extend the coal slurry carbon price support exemption to include coal derived from schemes supporting restoration projects is well worthy of serious consideration I cannot over emphasise the urgency of the situation I will not go into all the technical details as I had originally planned but people can read Hansard for 6 January if they want more details Obviously there are pros and cons to any proposal but this is the only game in town of which I am aware The recent proposals from other members of the Confederation of United Kingdom Coal Producers have come in only at the last minute and they have not been thought through I know that the Treasury has received a detailed analysis of the net economic impact and potential benefits of the scheme I am pleased that the Minister responded well to my debate on 6 January and said that he and Treasury officials would meet a group of us and perhaps some of my colleagues to discuss the proposals I look forward to that meeting taking place as soon as possible My main emphasis is that this is a disaster for our communities It cannot be ignored it must be dealt with as soon as possible

My right hon Friend makes an important point This Government and the previous Government have engaged with private sector companies for the delivery of public services Gordon Brown Labour s last successful Prime Minister Well he was the last Labour Member to hold the office May I take the opportunity to correct the record on that Mr Speaker Gordon Brown said It simply would not have been possible to build or refurbish such a number of schools and hospitals without using the PFI model Why is it that we use these contractors Because we know that they can deliver Labour s position is slightly confused Is it honestly now Labour s position that we should not use the private sector at all Is the state going to start building roads again Where does Labour draw the line It is complete confusion

The Minister is right to say that although the Sri Lankan Government crave a military victory there is a big difference between that and a military solution that will clearly not be delivered as a result of the actions in which they are engaged at the moment She seems to be saying that peace is a process rather than a single event What practical contribution have the UK Government been offering in recent months and years to a peace process It is clear that both sides must engage in order to achieve the long term sustainable peace that we all crave and that the whole of the Tamil community needs to be fully engaged in that kind of political process

I am bound to say that a great deal of money has gone into nuclear fusion already without very much to show for it If that money had gone into renewables we might be rather better off than we are I would not entirely slam the door on nuclear fusion but I certainly wish to slam it on nuclear fission for the reasons that I have given Waste concerns me greatly and no one could think that the Government have performed very well on the matter The waste hierarchy which everyone supports is applied upside down There is a perverse incentive to landfill and if not to landfill to incinerate and only then to recycle and reuse and waste minimisation get not even a look in

All attempts to raise the issues in Parliament whether in Government time or in other ways are welcome When we ultimately reach a Committee stage we might want to re examine the Bill to ascertain whether to include further mechanisms in it Given the good will in the House at least today I hope that we can find reasonable ways of realising that ambition Despite 30 odd years of anti discrimination legislation serious problems remain The gender pay gap is approximately 18 per cent on average and is grossly higher in some sectors of the economy especially financial services where it is about 60 per cent Members of ethnic minorities suffer from a similar gap for which only their ethnicity can account and it is as unacceptable as the gender pay gap The House will consider the Disability Discrimination Bill tomorrow thank goodness that will reach the statute book However people with disabilities are not even at the starting gate because many are denied the practical right to get to work participate fully in society and make the undoubted contribution that their many talents would bring to it We want the new single commission to assist us in dealing with those formidable problems I especially welcome the extension in part 2 of the goods and services protection on the ground of race However I echo the impatience that has been expressed in the Chamber today at the exclusion of what I call the orphan strands sexual orientation age and religious belief which currently have no primary legislation I suspect that we can put that right only through a rapid move to a single equality Act My right hon Friend the Minister knows that I have been pushing for that in the party it is now official party policy and in any other way that I can including involvement in the all party group and working with Lord Lester who is a doughty campaigner on such issues I promoted his private Member s Bill in this House after he managed to carry it in the other place It is important to get on with this matter quickly I especially welcome the duty in the Bill to promote equality on the ground of gender The Government promised to do that in 1998 but used the ominous phrase when legislative time is available Some of us have fought since then to ensure that legislative time would be made available We have not quite made it under the gate as it closes on this Parliament but I hope that we will revert to it as a matter of great urgency in the next I am encouraged by the response to my question by my right hon Friend the Member for Leicester East How could I confuse the Members for Leicester West and for Leicester East I must be having a tiring day I apologise to my hon Friend the Member for Leicester East Keith Vaz I was encouraged by the Secretary of State s answer that we would proceed rapidly from dress rehearsal to the real thing at the earliest opportunity in the next Parliament It is interesting that the Joint Committee on Human Rights described the Bill in uncharacteristically enthusiastic terms as the most important measure for the advancement of human rights in this country since the Human Rights Act itself I am encouraged that there is enthusiasm for creating a mechanism to ensure that the rights of British citizens under the Human Rights Act are effectively safeguarded without the need for extremely expensive and cumbersome constant recourse to the courts I know that other Members want to concentrate on that issue so I will not pursue it The fundamental duty of the single commission however is very welcome I agree with many of those who have said that we need a robust legal framework for the commission for equality and human rights to enforce That brings us back inexorably to the case for a single equality Act and the importance of ensuring that such an Act reaches the statute book as quickly as possible in the next Parliament consistent with doing a good job on the drafting To that end I am extremely encouraged that the discrimination law review has been set up with the equality review working in tandem with it to begin to do the work on what the single equality Act will look like It is important that that proceeds as quickly as possible so that the single commission has a coherent set of legislation to enforce once it is up and running It has been said that the existing anti discrimination law in the UK is rather complex Different figures have been given for the number of items I think that the hon Member for Buckingham Mr Bercow had slightly more up to date figures than I have I had a figure of slightly less than 100 but a few more statutory instruments and EU directives have probably passed me by since I last did a count We can all agree however that people must try to find their way through a tangled inconsistent unpredictable piecemeal and complex web even when as in the majority of cases I believe employers wish to do the right thing and ensure that they abide by the law Such a complex network of legislation and duties also makes it almost impossible for individuals who believe that they may have been discriminated against to find out by examining the law what their rights are how they might access them and how they might protect them unless they have the support of say a trade union or an advocacy group which can teach them and point out what their rights are Ideally a simplified harmonised approach is needed We need an approach that consolidates some of the law that we have but that also extends that law As many Members on both sides of the House have pointed out today there are some serious loopholes and inconsistencies in the law which create a hierarchy of discrimination and protection from discrimination which is unjustifiable when it is examined The existing law is under inclusive Those who are discriminated against on the grounds of gender race or disability are more widely protected than those who are discriminated against in relation to what I have referred to as the orphan strands the newer strands of sexual orientation age and religious belief As has been pointed out by other Members who have contributed to the debate those of a certain age or sexual orientation may be actively discriminated against in the provision of goods services or facilities yet have no redress in law The present position is ridiculous It is illegal for a landlord to say that he does not want a woman tenant or to prevent someone from becoming a tenant because of that person s colour but it is not illegal to refuse tenants because of their age or sexual orientation I cannot for the life of me see any justification for that It must be put right as quickly as possible As I said earlier we must shift the focus towards promotion and prevention rather than concentrating only on redress That means restructuring some of our current laws Our efforts to introduce a single equality Act must proceed in parallel with work that has already begun to create mechanisms for the enforcement of such a law and the establishment of the commission for equality and human rights I hope that in the next Parliament in the not too distant future we shall be able to enact both pieces of legislation I welcome this dress rehearsal and look forward to the real thing

I ran on a manifesto that included a referendum and I support it absolutely Let me deal with the argument that elected Lords will represent a shocking precedent and a threat to the constitutional order because they will be political partisans not to say apparatchiks put on party lists I remind right hon and hon Members that 80 of the current House of Lords were nominated by party leaders and the figure is higher if we look at voting numbers in that House Yesterday the hon Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire Jesse Norman who is not in his place said that the Lords defeated the Blair Governments 430 times and invited us to believe that that proved that the Lords were mighty enough already The truth is that the problem was not the power of the House of Lords but the fact that there was an in built Conservative majority when we came to power in 1997 The second issue that I want to deal with is more important It goes to the issue of the relationship between the House of Commons and the House of Lords something to which the hon Member for Portsmouth North Penny Mordaunt referred I have long argued for a single package of reform for both Houses but the alternative vote farrago or fiasco has put paid to that and we need to cut our Lords cloth accordingly given that we know that the electoral system for this place is not changing in the foreseeable future Many of those who have attacked the Bill have done so on two mutually contradictory grounds They have said that election to the Lords will mortally wound the primacy of the House of Commons the point that the hon Lady made and neuter the power of Government in the process At the same time they have argued that 15 year terms will not provide sufficient accountability for Members of the new House of Lords and that it is necessary for the new elected Lords to have more regular engagement with the electorate but opponents of the Bill cannot have it both ways The truth is that 15 year terms were designed in 2007 08 to minimise the challenge of an elected Lords to the Commons The electoral alternative to 15 year terms is five or 10 year terms with re election That really is a recipe for a challenge to the primacy of the House of Commons To oppose 15 year terms is to oppose any direct election at all That is a perfectly principled position but not one that I hold

My hon Friend is right In line with the commitment that we gave in the 2003 White Paper if the result of the new review announced by the Prime Minister is that we should go down the nuclear new build route that is a very big if because factors such as waste and cost have to be taken into account we will need to publish another White Paper and to have the widest possible consultation A very healthy public debate is going on but it is very different from that which took place even as recently as 2003 in terms of climate change and the need for security of supply I hope that we can ensure a proper comprehensive debate that examines the issues instead of people taking stances based on perhaps an ideological viewpoint Taking such stances will not help us to have the kind of debate that my hon Friend and I want

That might be essential for the celebration of Christmas in some people s eyes although I would not agree We come back to the point that several Members made eloquently on Second Reading are we suggesting that with all the trading days that we have in the year Christmas should be just another trading day because people cannot plan their Christmas shopping during the lead up to Christmas That period already sees not only every Sunday being used for shopping but late night opening and other ample opportunities for people to buy everything including booze and Bibles that they wish to purchase There is a similar position with children s toys and games I know that the family of the hon Member for Gainsborough Mr Leigh will be waiting in trepidation for a visit on Christmas day from the right hon Member for Bromley and Chislehurst but I am sure that should he arrive he would have had ample opportunity on the way to Gainsborough to purchase small gifts for them

We have come to an interesting point with Labour Members citing Margaret Thatcher and the fact that she founded the single market of the European Union to demonstrate just how wrong the current Government who claim her inheritance are in their international trade policy I have taken a number of interventions and I am very cognisant of your strictures for me to keep things to a minimum Madam Deputy Speaker As I was saying the alternative is to deliver certainty That alternative can come with a new customs union and a deal with the single market on regulations standards and common institutions that protects our trade with the EU and with our partners around the world The difficulties in renegotiating the deals with our partners have been laid bare in recent weeks by the failure of the International Trade Secretary to make progress on more than a handful of such deals quite apart from the uncertainty over our future trading relationship with the EU He wants to align to lower standards from the US

Yes I do share that view The Government rightly in many ways have said the previous Government said this too that defence is not simply a job creator for people on the home front so to speak The question of jobs and more importantly continuing capabilities is a valid part of this whole discussion and negotiation We could probably always buy almost any individual item more cheaply somewhere else but if we do that we will end up beholden to someone else for everything We must identify the capacities we want to retain as Lord Drayson s defence industrial strategy did and then be prepared to enter long term agreements with suppliers for them That will involve manpower and personnel planning to avoid peaks and troughs In the minute that remains I want to ask the Minister about base closures The Government must start making commitments fairly quickly not only to individual locations but about what they are prepared to do when bases are shut Will they promise Kinloss or Lossiemouth that they will clean up the land sites and spend money on infrastructure and making those sites available for firms to move in or are they simply going to pull up sticks and move away Many of those communities have served the country well for some substantial time and I hope that we will reward them appropriately or at least that we will not leave them swinging in the wind My final point is about our agreement with the French I hope that we are going to be as hard headed about it as they are and that it will not mean that they take over our industrial capacity rather than our being able to contribute to joint developments

I thank the right hon Gentleman for those comments He rightly says that shocked and horrified absolutely sum up the feelings in Northern Ireland over the past few days As I said in my statement there is no apology for this this was murder There is no justification There are no excuses This was taking the life of an innocent dynamic bright energetic young person depriving her of her future and depriving her partner and her family of their loved one There can be no excuse for that

The name of the Home Secretary appears on the Bill as one of its sponsors along with my name Clause 18 establishes the special prosecutor who will bring prosecutions in the special tribunal The special prosecutor will also have responsibility for liaising with victims to ensure that they are properly informed of the progress of cases that reach that stage Further details are in schedule 6 Clauses 19 to 27 contain ancillary provisions which include protections for information provided to the certification commissioner and the power to suspend and repeal provisions of the scheme Of course I would prefer it if the normal processes of the criminal law could be applied in all those cases but those who are outside Northern Ireland will not return on that basis

We left a legacy that formed a firm foundation for new endeavour We should have been going up not down The sad thing is the other side of this energy efficiency I think some 400 000 fewer homes were insulated as a result of the changes the Government made to energy insulation programmes another missed opportunity I really hope this new team will grasp it and when it is in the national interest work with everybody including us

That links in with what I was saying earlier If the Government do not learn from their mistakes how can they make improvements Universal credit is widely off track the work capability assessment has almost completely broken down personal independence payments are a fiasco the Work programme is not working the Youth Contract is a flop support for families with multiple problems are falling far short of its target the jobmatch website is an absurd embarrassment the unfair and vindictive bedroom tax is costing more money than it saves and the Government cannot even agree on a definition of child poverty let alone take action to deal with it To paraphrase Oscar Wilde to fail to deliver on one policy might be considered unfortunate to miss one s targets on two has to be judged careless but to make such a complete mess of every single initiative the Secretary of State has attempted requires a special gift It is something like a Midas touch everything he touches turns into a total shambles Meanwhile the Secretary of State will spew out dodgy statistics rant and rave about Labour s record say on time and on budget until he is blue in the face and in typical Tory style blame the staff for everything that goes wrong We have all long given up hope on the Secretary of State ever getting a grip on his Department The real question today is when will the Prime Minister learn and take responsibility for the slow motion car crash he has allowed to unfold The DWP has the highest spending of any Government Department and the responsibility for handling some of the most sensitive situations and some of the most vulnerable people in our country We will all be paying a price for a long time to come for this Government s failure to get a grip and the lives of too many people such as Malcolm Graham who is still waiting for his personal independence payment have been irreparably damaged It is clear that this Government will never take their responsibilities in this area with the seriousness that is needed Let me pledge today that a Labour Government will They will help those thousands of families who have been let down by the system and the millions of taxpayers who are seeing their money wasted That change cannot come soon enough

I have to say that my recollection is somewhat different I cannot remember in which Budget the now Prime Minister announced massive increases in expenditure on schools and hospitals but I can remember thinking that it was a make or break moment for the Government I thought that if it worked I did not think it would the history of the following 10 or 15 years might be very different but that if it all ended in tears as I thought it would we Conservatives would be vindicated I am afraid to say that I now know that we were vindicated the decisions the Prime Minister announced at that time proved to be the beginning of the obituary of this new Labour Government I sincerely wish that when the Prime Minister was Chancellor he had not been so imprudent with the money at his disposal or the money he was borrowing in funding that splurge Let me repeat the phrase risible optimism which was used by The Economist to describe the fundamental premise on which this Finance Bill is based I have not read the words of Edward Hadas before and I am not sure whether they appeared in The Daily Telegraph blog or in the main newspaper but I like his parallel Suppose a triple A rated company suddenly found that expenses were running at 123 per cent of revenues Such a huge loss would cause a financial red alert Cut back spending push up revenues figure out what s going wrong and prepare for even worse times That is exactly the situation we face as a nation I know that there are differences in finances companies and Governments but the scale of what we face is truly terrifying As the article makes clear even governments face limits and the UK authorities seem to be approaching them They have engaged in pretty much every imaginable risky policy Huge fiscal deficits are joined by the central bank s effective zero interest rate and a big experiment in money printing The article goes on to conclude about the risk of default on sovereign debts that the government might decide to spare taxpayers some pain by letting inflation erode the real value of the official debts The rating agencies do not count such depreciation as a default If they did the UK s triple A would probably be history already That is a terrifying conclusion The most recent estimate that undermines the credibility of the Budget and the Finance Bill came from the European Commission only this week as it issued its Economic Forecast It said that the UK economy is now clearly experiencing one of its worst recessions in recent history in the context of the global financial and economic crisis It also stated The unemployment rate is likely to rise progressively to around 10 per cent in late 2010 The consensus out there is now pretty clear the Government are being too optimistic To be fair to the Prime Minister I always like to be fair it is in my nature he probably believed his own propaganda and he might actually have believed that he could end boom and bust It is an extraordinary thought I read economics at university many years ago and I have forgotten most of it I was not even particularly good at it at the time

Michael Wilshaw has been a brilliant chief inspector and he is absolutely right about the situation in our prisons There are some outstanding examples of educational provision in prison but sadly too few One problem has been that a small group of providers has been responsible for providing education in prison but large and inflexible contracts have meant that those providers have not necessarily been as responsive to the needs of individual prisoners as they should have been That is changing thanks to the Coates report One thing that will not change however is the amount that we spend on education which has been safeguarded and ring fenced

I am not sure whether the hon Gentleman is suggesting that the two should be merged but I would have some concerns about that because it would create an extremely large organisation that dealt with individual supervision the stability of the financial markets and monetary policy I am not sure that that is the right approach I certainly would not want to go back to the regime that we had before 1997 I am not making a party political point I just think that that regime may have been appropriate in the 80s and 90s but it is not appropriate for the 21st century markets We should not lose sight of the following it was not because of the present supervisory structure that Northern Rock got into trouble It had a particular business model which left it very exposed in the event that liquidity dried up It is important that we keep that at the forefront of our minds when deciding what to do Whatever changes are necessary it is important to remember what the problem was in the first place and the problem that we are trying to fix

My hon Friend is absolutely right The major cuts in benefits in housing benefits tax credits and benefits affecting families come in the two final years The other thing that Members on the Government Benches simply do not seem to understand is the impact of the changes on work incentives The Government say that they want to promote a climate for growth One would think that if they were trying to promote a climate for growth they would improve work incentives The Government are about to test to destruction the theory that simply cutting benefits will improve work incentives That is illustrated in another table in the Red Book the Red Book is I have to say a rather useful document which shows the changes in the marginal deduction rates That table shows that almost 100 000 people will see increases in their marginal deduction rates as a result of the Budget that is a worsening of their incentives The level of transparency in the document is totally inadequate and it has been extremely difficult to get information out of the Government However in conclusion I would like to ask what is the balance of risk that the British economy now faces Is it spiralling inflation or is it deflation The choice that the Government have made is far more likely to push us towards deflation Before he sat down the Chancellor or the Exchequer said that the richest should pay the most and that the vulnerable would be protected in the Budget The Government have failed every test They have not been fair they have not promoted growth they are raising far too much money and this Budget will fail the nation

Yesterday after the urgent question I asked the Under Secretary of State for Health and Social Care my hon Friend the Member for Winchester Steve Brine why children from the poorest areas are disproportionately among the fattest and I suggested that it was not because they watched more adverts He responded that it might be the case that they watched more adverts I suggest to my hon Friend the Member for Angus Kirstene Hair that a piece of work needs to be done before the Bill proceeds to establish the exact role of advertising in making our children so much fatter The reality is that children have always been the target of such advertising She will be too young to recall but I certainly remember the Milkybar kid whose unique selling attraction was that the Milkybars were going to be on him My hon Friend suggested a much more profitable avenue for our attention She pointed out that by the time children came to school one in five was already too fat We will have those children in school for the best part of 15 years for five days a week and 40 weeks a year It would be staggeringly unproductive if we did not use that time to sufficiently exercise them to make them thinner I suggest that if we have not the political will to do that advertising is not going to do the job Question put and agreed to Ordered That Kirstene Hair Kerry McCarthy Conor McGinn Fiona Bruce Andrew Selous Stuart C McDonald John Lamont Paul Masterton Mr Alister Jack Jamie Stone Mr Alistair Carmichael and Bill Grant present the Bill Kirstene Hair accordingly presented the Bill Bill read the First time to be read a Second time on Friday 23 November and to be printed Bill 237

Thank you Mr Speaker It is nice to get such a warm welcome and may I wish all Members as well as all members of staff in the House a happy new year I hope the whole House will join me I am sure it will in paying tribute to 22 year old Lance Corporal Scott Hetherington who died in a non combat incident in Iraq last Monday I am sure the whole House will also join in sending its heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of seven year old Katie Rough who tragically died in York earlier this week I think it is right that we send condolences to her family Last week 485 people in England spent more than 12 hours on trolleys in hospital corridors The Red Cross described this as a humanitarian crisis I called on the Prime Minister to come to Parliament on Monday but she did not she sent the Health Secretary But does she agree with him that the best way to solve the crisis of the four hour wait is to fiddle the figures so that people are not seen to be waiting so long on trolleys in NHS hospitals

The hon Gentleman helps my point We would then provide an alternative livelihood to the Afghan poppy farmer that he would not have if we simply destroyed his crop or tried to persuade him with a packet of seeds to grow some alternative crop for which there is no market mechanism We have to work constructively first to ensure that we preserve the livelihood of Afghan farmers and their families and secondly to create the market mechanisms for the alternative crops that I know they can grow However that will take time and patience on our part as well as money We need to commit that money because if we cut off the money supply of the Taliban and the other insurgent groups we will have gone a long way towards winning the battle in Afghanistan In the last few minutes left I want to refer to Europe not to the treaty or the referendum but to the common foreign and security policy which is of course mentioned in the treaty in the sense that it is intergovernmental I remind the House that when the break up of Yugoslavia took place some years ago we all lamented the fact that Europe was unable to respond either politically or militarily We all had different responses as individual nations recognising different bits of the break up of Yugoslavia at different times It was not until we managed to enlist the United States and NATO that we were able to bring a military presence to the area We lamented what happened because Europe had no mechanism with which to respond It did not exist at that stage it now does exist We have developed the common foreign and security policy over a number of years One of the organs of that through the European security and defence policy is Operation Althea the peacekeeping force in Bosnia which has worked reasonably successfully although there are currently a few concerns At that time there was a security and political situation on Europe s doorstep that was degenerating fast but to which we had no means of responding Today there are at least two other situations on Europe s doorstep that are developing in a not dissimilar fashion although one is about break ups I refer to the situation on the border between Turkey and Iraq a situation involving an applicant member for the European Union and a full NATO member being bombarded from the other side by terrorist groups and on so and to Georgia Georgia wants to join NATO and eventually the European Union but has disputed territory in which Russia is playing an unhelpful part Now that we have developed the apparatus of CSFP with battle groups that are ready to be deployed at 15 days notice are those not areas where we could prove once and for all that European nations can work together to respond to situations that develop in our own backyard and that we are not for ever dependent on the United States to come to our rescue I make a plea to the Minister to ensure through his representatives in Brussels that both the political and security committee and the military committee of the European Union discuss the issue urgently

I was brought up as an orthodox Jew and a Zionist On a shelf in our kitchen there was a tin box for the Jewish National Fund into which we put coins to help the pioneers building a Jewish presence in Palestine I first went to Israel in 1961 and I have been there since more times than I can count I had family in Israel and have friends in Israel One of them fought in the wars of 1956 1967 and 1973 and was wounded in two of them The tie clip that I am wearing is made from a campaign decoration awarded to him which he presented to me I have known most of the Prime Ministers of Israel starting with the founding Prime Minister David Ben Gurion Golda Meir was my friend as was Yigal Allon Deputy Prime Minister who as a general won the Negev for Israel in the 1948 war of independence My parents came to Britain as refugees from Poland Most of their families were subsequently murdered by the Nazis in the holocaust My grandmother was ill in bed when the Nazis came to her home town of Staszow A German soldier shot her dead in her bed My grandmother did not die to provide cover for Israeli soldiers murdering Palestinian grandmothers in Gaza The current Israeli Government ruthlessly and cynically exploit the continuing guilt among gentiles over the slaughter of Jews in the holocaust as justification for their murder of Palestinians The implication is that Jewish lives are precious but the lives of Palestinians do not count On Sky News a few days ago the spokeswoman for the Israeli army Major Leibovich was asked about the Israeli killing of at that time 800 Palestinians the total is now 1 000 She replied instantly that 500 of them were militants That was the reply of a Nazi I suppose that the Jews fighting for their lives in the Warsaw ghetto could have been dismissed as militants The Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni asserts that her Government will have no dealings with Hamas because they are terrorists Tzipi Livni s father was Eitan Livni chief operations officer of the terrorist Irgun Zvai Leumi who organised the blowing up of the King David hotel in Jerusalem in which 91 victims were killed including four Jews Israel was born out of Jewish terrorism Jewish terrorists hanged two British sergeants and booby trapped their corpses Irgun together with the terrorist Stern gang massacred 254 Palestinians in 1948 in the village of Deir Yassin Today the current Israeli Government indicate that they would be willing in circumstances acceptable to them to negotiate with the Palestinian President Abbas of Fatah It is too late for that They could have negotiated with Fatah s previous leader Yasser Arafat who was a friend of mine Instead they besieged him in a bunker in Ramallah where I visited him Because of the failings of Fatah since Arafat s death Hamas won the Palestinian election in 2006 Hamas is a deeply nasty organisation but it was democratically elected and it is the only game in town The boycotting of Hamas including by our Government has been a culpable error from which dreadful consequences have followed The great Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban with whom I campaigned for peace on many platforms said You make peace by talking to your enemies However many Palestinians the Israelis murder in Gaza they cannot solve this existential problem by military means Whenever and however the fighting ends there will still be 1 5 million Palestinians in Gaza and 2 5 million more on the west bank They are treated like dirt by the Israelis with hundreds of road blocks and with the ghastly denizens of the illegal Jewish settlements harassing them as well The time will come not so long from now when they will outnumber the Jewish population in Israel It is time for our Government to make clear to the Israeli Government that their conduct and policies are unacceptable and to impose a total arms ban on Israel It is time for peace but real peace not the solution by conquest which is the Israelis real goal but which it is impossible for them to achieve They are not simply war criminals they are fools

As usual we have a had a wide ranging and thoughtful debate on a serious and complex issue Even in this complex and differential issue there are areas of agreement We agree that the immigration system should work well and that it has not done so and does not do so now My hon Friends the Members for Hackney North and Stoke Newington Ms Abbott for Sheffield Central Paul Blomfield and for Islington North Jeremy Corbyn mentioned that as did the right hon Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark Simon Hughes We accept that we need effective border checks to stop illegal immigrants from entering at source Members on both sides of the House agree on that We need to identify overstayers and take action in the interests of the whole country As the hon Member for Esher and Walton Mr Raab has said we need to ensure that we deport at the end of their sentences foreign based prisoners who have committed offences I recognise that there is a benefit to immigration as does the hon Member for Cambridge Dr Huppert and in part the hon and learned Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham Stephen Phillips Hon Members spoke of the benefits of tourism The hon Member for Perth and North Perthshire Pete Wishart my hon Friend the Member for Islington North and even dare I say it the right hon Member for Mid Sussex Nicholas Soames said that there has been and is a need to bring skills to help create wealth in this country We need to ensure we maximise the wealth genuine students can bring as the hon Member for Cambridge has said We also need to maximise the good will they feel about the UK when they leave I was struck by the excellent speech of my hon Friend the Member for Lewisham East Heidi Alexander who spoke of the cultural benefits and pointed to the strong support in her community for many cultural changes Hon Members even appear to agree on dare I say it ad vans I want to put on record my thanks to the Minister of State Home Department the hon Member for Lewes Norman Baker for his strong intervention in the past 48 hours According to the Evening Standard it was the Liberals what did it I would be grateful for confirmation of that in due course

I agree that the issue is about sending a message that carrying knives is not acceptable so education will be a part of it and the deterrent effect will be a part of that I want to speak briefly to clause 19 in part 1 largely because it started life as a new clause that I tabled in Committee To my delight it was accepted by Ministers at that stage with welcome support from both sides of the Committee The clause proposes a small but potentially highly significant change to the Malicious Communications Act 1988 making offences under it either way rather than summary only offences In short it will allow magistrates to refer certain malicious communication offences the most egregious at least up to the Crown court for tougher sentencing The other crucial aspect of the change is that the six month time limit on bringing a case to court will be dropped leaving more time to investigate where necessary I hope and believe that one of the key effects will be to provide for much tougher penalties for the worst cases of cyber bullying and consequently that there will be much more of a deterrent My interest in pursuing this matter was first aroused by a visit to my Ealing surgery by constituents whose daughter had been the victim of appalling sex texting by a neighbour The girl was 14 at the time and he was in his 40s They were desperately disappointed because even though the man admitted to the texts the Crown Prosecution Service was unable to identify an offence that the courts could accept He eventually walked free from the Crown court and any chance of prosecution under the Malicious Communications Act had gone because of the six month time limit That appalling situation was unacceptable there must be many more like it and it needed a legal remedy After taking advice from numerous colleagues with a legal background including the Attorney General whom I thank for his time the local police and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children I saw this small but important change shaped and accepted by my right hon Friend the Justice Secretary and his ministerial team I thank Ministers for their ready support for the measure and I am delighted that it was incorporated into the Bill with the support of all those who served on the Committee The family who came to see me are so pleased and I hope much good can come from it

It is not often that one gets the chance to react with a legislative proposal so soon after a Minister has made a particular threat At the weekend the Deputy Prime Minister in answer to various journalists questions said that the Government were considering capping certain local authorities that were increasing their council tax by large amounts I was particularly concerned to hear that as it went against much of what Labour said in opposition and in government with respect to capping powers I therefore felt that it was appropriate as we had the chance to do so today to probe this issue to see whether we could help the Labour Government put on the statute books the policy to which they subscribed in opposition rightly Labour in opposition was against capping powers When the Conservatives were in power the Liberal Democrats with the Labour party used to criticise the way the Conservative Government time after time used capping powers to stop local authorities reacting to the wishes of their electorate to invest in services whether services in our schools services for elderly people services for vulnerable children or services more widely in the communities that councillors were elected to represent It is therefore disappointing that when this Government came to power they slightly changed their policy They kept some reserve capping powers and to use the Deputy Prime Minister s words they got rid of crude capping and somehow introduced sophisticated capping in the Local Government Act 1999 Some of us feel that that type of capping is still not right The reason for that is simple these issues should be decided by the electorate in the areas of the councils concerned We have some concerns of course that councils may be using opportunities to rack up the council tax When I raised the issue at questions earlier today the Minister I think that he had Wandsworth borough council in mind responded that some councils had cut the council tax before the election and were now raising it significantly He has a problem with that case as he well knows because while I would not wish to support Wandsworth s methods the way in which it cut the tax before the election and has now put it up is outrageous the people who should judge that are the electors of Wandsworth The Minister has another problem the comprehensive performance assessment of various councils has for some reason rated Wandsworth an excellent council The Government under their policy of freedoms and flexibilities have said that they would not apply capping to those sorts of councils so they have a real problem with the way in which they approach the matter It would be simplest to get rid of capping powers altogether which is the effect of new clause 19 I hope that we will have some support from Conservative Members on that

I could not agree more I am concerned that some of the banks involved in the scheme now fear that they have played by the rules while others have not If there is no transparency on that issue banks may go into future schemes with the same attitude as RBS s attitude to this scheme We do not have bank by bank details on outcomes so it is very difficult to measure whether they are appropriate In the same way there is real concern that the FCA has not fully shared its legal opinion on excluding businesses with embedded swaps from the whole review process In the briefing that the FCA provided for this debate it implies that it has fully shared its information on that with the Treasury Committee but my understanding is that it was willing only to allow a QC acting on the Treasury Committee s behalf not its members to see the information I do not consider that to be full accountability to Parliament I said that I would call on the FCA to consider an appeal process In view of the revelations about the possible activities of the KPMG reviewers of RBS there is merit in a proposal made by the all party group a year and a half ago All the independent reviewers have been trained to the FCA s satisfaction so if an RBS client is unhappy with its outcome it would surely be appropriate to ask another independent reviewer for example Deloitte which acts in relation to HSBC to review the case That would not unduly complicate the situation because the reviewers have been trained by the RCA and have satisfied it as to their expertise It would give clients a degree of independence if those unhappy with the redress outcome could have all the case notes reviewed by a third party that is independent of the original bank and of its independent reviewer Will the Economic Secretary consider that request

My hon Friend with his huge knowledge of such matters is right The Government are having to produce a special planning grant to try to encourage local authorities such as mine that are extremely short of staff due to high housing costs to employ planning officers The same would apply for valuation officers in the listing authorities Of course as has rightly been suggested the solution would be to employ the private sector to do the work There would then be no need for a permanent overhead The amendment is premature It contains many good intentions as is always the case with proposals made by my hon Friend the Member for Mole Valley However we should wait for Sir Michael Lyons to make his report and reconsider the amendment in due course

We are certainly confident that there will be fairness The paving Bill strikes the appropriate balance between maintaining momentum behind proposals that have wide indeed all party support and recognising that serious issues need to be debated There will be pre legislative scrutiny and a draft Bill is to be published so the House will have the opportunity to consider all the proposals in the main communications Bill That should give the hon Gentleman comfort

Indeed it is and perhaps I was expressing myself unclearly The difficulty for anyone who presides over such an inquiry so long after the event is that when the evidence is oral that was principally the evidence that was directly relevant to the matters that the tribunal had to consider it is undoubtedly weakened by the passage of time The oral evidence was less satisfactory than it would have been much closer to the events in question That brings me to Lord Widgery s report back in 1972 He was able to consider the events much closer to the time but having read his report on several occasions and for this debate I have always had as I have today and as many hon Members have a feeling of considerable unease even if it does not rise to the same level as that in the mind of the hon Member for Birmingham Erdington Jack Dromey The report was produced in a different era by a judge of a different mettle from Lord Saville who had served in the Army during the second world war and who in the 10 weeks available to him to deal with the matter was deprived of much of the evidence that subsequently emerged It is not my function on this or any other occasion to defend Lord Widgery great judge as he was in many respects I suspect that he was hindered by the absence of evidence before him and by his training but I also suspect that he was hindered by his outlook Constitutionally it was impossible for judges at that time to accept that soldiers from the Parachute Regiment like policemen who gave evidence would not be telling the truth when they said that they were fired upon before they fired We shall never know the truth of who fired first but even with the passage of time and having read the report in its entirety I have little doubt given the evidence that supports its conclusions that Lord Saville came much closer to the truth even on the balance of probabilities in finding as he clearly does that the first shots were fired by the British Army I suspect however that neither we in this House nor anyone else will ever know for sure who fired the first shot I accept entirely as do the whole House and the Government the conclusions that Lord Saville reached but I have regretted some of the things that have been said about them by some in Northern Ireland whatever hurt and anguish they might have carried to this day as a result of the events of Bloody Sunday I want to say a little about the position in which 1 Para found itself in Derry on that day The situation was in a sense unprecedented in modern British history and that should not be forgotten when we consider the report and the motion on the Order Paper It was a situation in part of the United Kingdom in which the civilian authorities had effectively lost control of a British city and had not the means to regain it even if they had been willing to make the effort The Official IRA and the Provisional IRA were both active in the area and there was real concern that there might be violence between the communities on either side of the sectarian divide during the march planned for that day That was all taking place against a background of the nationalist anger directed at the Army and the Government that had previously given rise to the many other incidents of violence that Lord Saville dealt with in his report Referring to the so called Saturday matinées the regular incidents of rioting that took place at the corner of Rossville street and William street a junction known to British soldiers as aggro corner the report said We have little doubt that had the crowd isolated a soldier it is likely that he would have been killed The British Army was facing such regular instances of rioting at the time in Derry and elsewhere in that part of the world In this country we expect a lot of our young soldiers We expect their bravery their loyalty and their obedience and we are right to do so Yet soldiers are no more superhuman than the rest of us as my hon Friend the Member for Beckenham Bob Stewart can tell us The stress under which they must have found themselves day after day on the streets of Northern Ireland must not be forgotten or underestimated Their lives were at risk and no one should doubt that to have been the case That said however following the Saville report I cannot associate myself with what my hon Friend the Member for Newark Patrick Mercer said earlier If criminal acts were committed that day the passage of time should not be seen to exculpate those responsible and the course of the law will have to follow In a very real sense given these facts Bloody Sunday was a catastrophe waiting to happen Whoever fired the first shot and whatever actually happened on that day all sides involved in the troubles must shoulder some of the blame This long awaited report perhaps too long awaited and certainly too expensive offers the House the people of Northern Ireland and the country the ability to draw a line under this awful chapter in our history The truth is now out and I hope that this opportunity will be taken so that we can finally ensure that there is peace in Northern Ireland

I should tell the House that I do not intend taking the full time available so Members will be spared that I thank the Financial Secretary for coming to the House to respond to the debate I was alarmed and disappointed that I had to apply for this debate and was granted it so soon after the debate on HMRC closures on 29 April in this Chamber The Minister will know there has been a worrying unilateral change on the part of HMRC which has decided to close the Walsall office on 20 June 2016 That has been brought forward much to the shock of people who work there This debate is about public servants and those who have worked in the public interest and how we treat them If we want society to thrive we need a balance between the public sector and the private sector The public sector provides the framework of a good society doing the things that it is harder for the private sector to do and that the private sector says it wants Government to do The debate last week showed how important it was for tax to be collected All that revenue should go into public services the NHS education skills and infrastructure among other things In the previous debate I referred to the tax gap the difference between the tax owed and the tax collected The Minister referred to it too in his summing up In a survey undertaken in 2014 Richard Murphy said that the tax gap stood at almost 119 billion from tax evasion That figure has not been challenged and that is the scale of the amount of tax that needs to come back into the public purse We need to collect that in order to pay for everything the Government have invested in public services Today I hope to persuade the Minister of the case for retaining the office and dealing urgently with the issues of HMRC staff in Walsall What happened to the Walsall office at Pattinson House offends British values and natural justice Under Building our Future it was announced in November 2015 that the office was to close by March 2017 Then on 4 May HMRC decided that all personal tax staff were to be compulsorily moved to Birmingham some six weeks later on 20 June 2016 A collective grievance had been brought against the office and many staff fear that this announcement may be a reprisal for the collective grievance and a petition I am pleased to see my hon Friend the Member for Walsall North Mr Winnick in the Chamber He and I were in the town centre that day and we saw how the public responded to the petition some 500 signatures were collected in about an hour and a half supporting the retention of the office I do not believe I have had a response to the petition from the Department or from the Select Committee The grounds for the collective grievance were that HMRC failed to follow Cabinet Office redundancy protocols including moving the administrative assistants into redundancy procedures unnecessarily HMRC denied trade union representation in one to one discussions with staff about whether they could practically travel to Birmingham HMRC failed to carry out an equality impact assessment for the closure HMRC refused to offer staff the opportunity to move to sites other than Birmingham despite alternative sites being more accessible for some staff HMRC ignored evidence of increased journey times for Walsall staff in favour of an unproven use of a variant of Google Maps to estimate journey times and HMRC refused to subject the closure plans to parliamentary scrutiny or to accept accountability for them HMRC eventually responded to the grievance but only to claim that it failed to meet the Department s test of a legitimate grievance HMRC refused to investigate the grievance under the Department s procedures It cannot be right that the guidelines have not been followed and that the closure has been brought forward to June The Minister has said in written answers and to the House that HMRC had given a commitment to staff that they would have a one to one meeting with their manager to discuss their options at least one year ahead of their office closure That clearly has not happened in the case of Walsall He also said that changing locations was not cutting staff but the staff in Walsall have been given no choice and some are being made redundant The Minister has also said that it is an operational matter but who is the executive of HMRC accountable to When the Minister said that the Government had asked HMRC to reduce costs that is a policy matter not an operational matter The Minister said that the change would make it quicker and easier for taxpayers to report and pay their taxes online Does that include those who have offshore accounts There are still appeals outstanding Those who are out of scope for a move do not know what will happen to them There are still concerns about travel support The Public and Commercial Services Union has not been consulted It was just told that a resource planning project had been announced Now staff have been given six weeks to reorganise their lives and their caring responsibilities when they were expecting that period to be almost a year I want to touch on the impact on Walsall Walsall South has consistently higher levels of unemployment claimants than the rest of the region and the UK 4 4 of constituents claimed unemployment benefits compared with a UK wide figure of 2 5 An assessment by Coventry City Council suggested that with the loss of quality jobs almost 1 5 billion would be taken out of the local economy a figure that I have cited before Walsall South cannot afford to lose such a sum

I am afraid the right hon Gentleman does not know the difference people in Northern Ireland are very clear about this between the principle of consent and actually giving consent He has made a mistake that is consistently made and it is a mistake that will strain some people s belief in the Good Friday agreement People such as the right hon Gentleman do not recognise the damage that they are doing Carefully compacted layers of understanding created the bedrock of the Good Friday agreement and fissures are being driven into those key foundations Remember that as a result of that agreement the principle of consent is housed in the Irish constitution as well because the referendum north and south changed the constitution It removed the territorial claim and two additional clauses were inserted If the key constitutional precept of the Good Friday agreement is not housed in any new UK EU treaty that might result from these negotiations we shall be in a very serious situation The promise and the understanding that the people of Ireland north and south were given when they endorsed the Good Friday agreement in overwhelming numbers will have been betrayed and damaged I do not accept and no Irish nationalist north or south who supported the Good Friday agreement has ever said that the principle of consent that is housed in the Irish constitution can be removed replaced or surpassed by a vote in England on Brexit or on anything else The Good Friday agreement states very clearly that the question of Irish unity will be a matter for the people of Ireland north and south without external impediment That key principle must be reflected in any new UK EU treaty making clear that if in the future Northern Ireland votes to become part of a united Ireland it will do so as an automatic part of the EU without any change in Ireland s terms of membership and without the need for any new negotiations on the part of Northern Ireland We cannot afford in the Northern Ireland context the sort of trickery that was used in the Scottish context to raise question marks over whether EU membership would apply This is a key principle and tenet for those of us in the House who support the Good Friday agreement There are other risks to the agreement as well There are risks to the weight of the rights in strand 1 There is also significant damage afoot in relation to strand 2 which involved a delicate balance of institutional and constitutional arrangements That strand will be left in complete deficit after Brexit unless someone takes care of it

My right hon Friend the Home Secretary advises me that a previous Home Secretary did produce such a document on that matter However the point of the hon Gentleman s question is not who produced it but gullibility The hon Gentleman should test the temperature of the hour and understand the view of the people of this country who need secure identity and security of their borders The people are overwhelmingly in favour of developing this policy but they want it done carefully and delivered appropriately That is exactly what the Government will do

My hon Friend is right to pay tribute to the Royal Air Force We have touched on the role of the British Army but over the past two years since the House gave its authority for strikes in Iraq we have seen the most intense campaign being managed by the Royal Air Force from Akrotiri and other bases in the Gulf at a tempo we have not seen since the first Gulf war I know the House would want to pay tribute not only to the pilots who fly the planes but to the huge back up operation that sits behind them On his particular point about medical support perhaps he will allow me to write to him

I have two things to say to that Is it a good thing that youth unemployment or the claimant count at least has fallen in my constituency Yes it is Do I give the Government credit for that Well I am not sure whether it is down to the Government or not so we should put that to one side We would not be debating the proposal and it would not have been included in the autumn statement if the Government did not believe that youth unemployment is still an issue and a problem Many statements are being made about how wonderful it is that youth unemployment is coming down but the Government clearly believe like us that there is still a problem If there was no problem I doubt the proposal would have been made Although many young people are not necessarily unemployed for long periods there are groups of young people who find themselves unemployed for a year or even two years which as we know is of huge consequence to people s future life health well being and income

Does the Minister agree that the most popular Government in the UK at the moment are the Scottish Government They happen to be a minority Government and they have the advantage that they cannot force through any measures on their own but need other parties to join with them That tends to give a majority view to issues that are carried forward and STV at council level means that people have the choice to bypass sleepy traditional councillors

The fact is that business simply does not believe that the Government are doing enough Last month the head of the British Chambers of Commerce said that he would give key politicians presumably the Secretary of State is one of them three out of 10 for delivery A couple of weeks before members of the Institute of Directors went further stating that Government policies to support business were ineffective in every single area and who can blame them The Government have failed to deliver on their infrastructure plan they have failed to get finance to businesses that need it and they have failed to meet the delivery targets in their 2011 plan for growth The Government are ridden with indecision Three marks out of 10 was generous How many marks would the Business Secretary give the Government given their litany of failure

After five hours of debate it is difficult to make a point that has not already been raised Nevertheless that gives one the opportunity to reflect on the debate and it is in that spirit that I say that I had intended to declare my support for the amendment tabled by my right hon Friend the Member for Islington South and Finsbury Mr Smith and nothing I have heard in the debate has persuaded me that I should change my mind My right hon Friend made the fundamental point that he sought to persuade the House that the case for military action is as yet unproven I believe that to be the case However and other hon Members who will support the amendment tonight may disagree I cannot pretend that I have not been impressed by my colleagues on the Front Bench including the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary Some hon Members have gone over the top in their criticisms of the role that my right hon Friends have played I am not regarded as a critic of the United States and I do not take the view that our Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary have simply responded to everything that the United States has said Indeed whatever criticisms I might have I believe that when the history of this period is written it may well record that far from the picture painted by I am sorry to say the hon Member for Banff and Buchan Mr Salmond for example our Prime Minister had a great influence towards caution and stability on the part of the United States Without him Bush would not have gone to the United Nations at all That said we are entitled to consider the consequences of a unilateral declaration of war In common with the right hon and learned Member for Rushcliffe Mr Clarke I take the view that some in the US Administration had already determined their position some time ago I regret that whatever the arguments and the force of public opinion and whatever the views expressed in this House some in Washington seem determined to take unilateral action and that could be very costly indeed Already we see problems in international organisations that I firmly support I regret the unease in NATO the disagreements within the European Union and above all the questions of credibility that have been placed at the door of the United Nations I am sorry that even during this debate several hon Members have said that if we do not respond to unilateral action we will be following the route of the League of Nations That organisation was destroyed because people failed to give it the kind of support that the United Nations is entitled to expect not least from this House today On some of my visits abroad I have seen evidence of the carnage that hon Members on both sides of the House have mentioned in their speeches I have visited Kurdistan on two occasions I do not necessarily reach the same conclusions as the hon Member for Castle Point Bob Spink and my hon Friend the Member for Falkirk East Mr Connarty tells me that he intends to support the amendment When I visited Iran in the late 1980s I saw the evidence of people suffering from the use of chemical weapons by Saddam Hussein But in view of that is it not all the more necessary that we should confirm the importance of the United Nations and its agencies in seeking a response to these problems More recently I visited Rwanda with some of my hon Friends including my hon Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow Ms King We saw there the aftermath of sheer genocide a million people dying out of a population of 9 million and we saw people now trying to deal with what took place I do not want to weaken the United Nations influence in circumstances like that I want to strengthen it but I do not believe that it would be strengthened by unilateral action It is right that my right hon Friend the Member for Islington South and Finsbury should give the lead tonight by inviting the House to express that view I am concerned about humanitarian considerations That is why I am very keen to hear what Dr Hans Blix eventually has to say I do not believe that we should rush to judgment nor do I believe that the British people feel that we should do so If those of us who supported the Government s actions on Afghanistan on humanitarian grounds and who supported the Government s actions on Kosovo on humanitarian grounds take the view that there are grave concerns about the humanitarian consequences of war with Iraq that seems to me entirely logical a position shared by virtually all the aid agencies and non governmental organisations including CAFOD and one to be taken seriously We want to avoid refugees We want to avoid carnage We want if we can to avoid war That may not be possible but I believe that it is right and that it strengthens the role of those who desperately search for peace to support my right hon Friend s amendment in the hope that we are addressing the concerns not just of our own people but of an increasingly disenchanted world

I beg to move That leave be given to bring in a Bill to enable local planning authorities to determine the number of houses built in their areas As Sebastian O Kelly editor of Property on Sunday says Like distant thunder war is coming to England s peaceful shires Battle is soon to be joined between Government and those who want to save something of the villages and countryside in the South East It is a clash that will pitch all the power of central government and the artful pleading of self interested builders against local democracy Sebastian O Kelly exposed a Treasury report that urged the building of 2 5 million more houses As he said To build them the Government needs to overturn the planning process that has existed for 50 years a process that has spared us again and again from the most appalling excesses of ill thought out speculative development National recognition of the Government s planning changes now extends to local communities For instance on 5 January Castle Point wildlife action group wrote as follows Like a lot of local people we are very concerned about excessive development in the Borough which is destroying much wildlife habitat and our quality of life The Government s massive building programme will hugely exacerbate the problem I congratulate the group on its care of our environment and wildlife and I seek to legislate to reverse the Government s rapid move towards more building and less democratic local control over it I should point out of course that not all new development is bad We need more social housing in my constituency perhaps 100 units or so and more affordable housing for our children and for public sector workers but we do not need the thousands of extra houses that the Government are trying to force on us Let me illustrate the change in numbers Castle Point borough council had a target of 2 400 new houses and although we are well over half way through the planning period only 700 have been identified and built That shows how extravagant the target was Yet the Government now want to impose a massively ramped up target of 4 000 on Castle Point to be built by 2021 Amazingly though Castle Point has got off lightly Thurrock must build an astounding 18 500 new houses Basildon 10 700 and Southend on Sea 6 000 and so it goes on The Government are further increasing the target for Essex s house building to an outrageous 6 500 extra houses every year right up to 2021 The villain of the piece is of course the Deputy Prime Minister who identified four growth areas the fast becoming discredited Thames Gateway Milton Keynes Ashford and London and Stansted and Cambridge As the campaigning Steve Neale of the Yellow Advertiser put it Green belt loss looms with 43 800 more houses earmarked for south Essex alone in the near future threatening hundreds of acres of green belt The Government seek to achieve that massive building by increasing density packing them in and creating potential ghettos in a planning orgy like that of the 1960s which created so many sink communities But the Deputy Prime Minister has a problem Decent local councillors who are responsible for making planning decisions refuse to go along with the Government s plans to build over our beautiful green belt and destroy our quality of life They do so for very good reason Local councillors are directly accountable to local people They live in their local communities and therefore have a vested interest in protecting their environment They also want sustainable development which means new jobs new infrastructure and new investment in public services The editor of the Basildon Evening Echo hit the nail on the head on 28 January writing Without a new integrated system of roads and public transport the Gateway is just a dead duck in the Essex mud The cash required to establish the necessary transport development is 1 6 billion Yet the Govt s road finance plan fails to acknowledge the existence of the Thames Gateway Or for that matter South Essex Even now we need improved infrastructure particularly roads and public transport We need public service improvements and investment in schools doctors dentists sewage treatment plants and waste disposal And we need to build up flood defences and stop building on flood plains We need police stations that are open and offer access to the public and more policemen on the beat to tackle thuggery and street crime levels that are entirely out of control and threatening to spawn dangerous vigilante responses as I stated in the House last month Faced with the local difficulty of councillors and editors protecting their local communities as they should the Government are removing planning powers from democratic control in those communities and imposing Big Brother controls from above The Government s Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill changes the system from one in which there is considerable democratic input with local councils making decisions within local plans that comply with county council structure plans which in turn reflect Government planning guidance into one in which the Government will impose a regional SS spatial strategies abolishing local control and structure plans completely Regional housing gestapos called regional housing boards will ensure delivery of the Government s massive increase in building with cram them in densities and green belt destruction whether communities like it or not These SSs or gestapos like all gestapos are unelected unaccountable remote and faceless Yet the Government present this new Labour policy as neighbourhood renewal and neighbourhood renaissance They use facile language to cover their dubious intent They refuse to listen to the people as they bulldoze through our local democracy and our environment The Minister for Housing and Planning visited my constituency a month ago on his Thames Gateway tour He told the local papers that he wanted to protect and improve the environment on Canvey Island which he described as having a unique diversity He went on to say I am confident we can develop it He did not seem to understand the irony and contradiction in his statement which was reminiscent of the Deputy Prime Minister s exhortation that Labour s green belt policy was a great achievement and that they intended to build on it The people of Castle Point did not need the Minister to tell them that they have a wonderful environment nor that it needs protecting They do need him to stop increasing the building targets that will destroy it Sebastian O Kelly made the argument against the increased building targets very well when he said that nothing much needs to be done to redress the alleged housing shortage in the South East The housing market itself is already offering a solution Thanks to high property prices in the South for the first time since the Sixties the great cities of the North are coming back to life Residents are flooding back to the centres of Manchester Newcastle Leeds and now even Liverpool The whole of Britain s economy that has been dangerously tilted towards the South East is at last beginning to right itself and wealth is spreading through to the distant regions far more evenly Do we really want to endanger this laudable trend by building masses of cheap houses for uncertain demand in the South East We all know that when politicians stop listening the public will vote them out That is Labour s destiny In short my Bill draws attention to the Government s increase in building targets removal of local democracy and lack of sustainable infrastructure investment My Bill would enable local planning authorities to determine the number of houses built in their areas It would lead therefore to the protection of local democracy a reduction in the number of new houses higher quality development that is in touch with local needs environmental protection and improved infrastructure My Bill would truly safeguard communities It simply puts trust where it should be in the people as opposed to Labour s Big Brother approach of imposing inappropriate targets and destroying democracy I commend the Bill to the House Question put and agreed to Bill ordered to be brought in by Bob Spink Mr Peter Lilley Mr Eric Pickles Mr Simon Burns Mr David Amess Mr Mark Francois Sir Teddy Taylor Mr Andrew Rosindell Angela Watkinson Mr John Baron Ann Winterton and Mr John Redwood

This is an important opportunity to look once again at the Government s proposals and to consider the changes incorporated by the Lords I welcome the steps that the Government have taken recently to secure the substance of their programme Inevitably questions about personal privacy civil liberties system security cross predictability and function creep must be taken into account in the development of an identity verification system but by removing compulsion in relation to entry on the national identity register and in dealing with designated documents the substance of the amendments the Lords would make the system less secure and its use in public services less effective In fact the measures address none of the substantive issues with which Parliament might properly be concerned and can be considered only as spoiling tactics designed to make the implementation of ID cards impossible in practice If those are the Opposition s tactics that is by no means clear from what the hon and learned Member for Harborough Mr Garnier has said today they are not in the interests of the British people do not reflect the world in which we live and frankly constitute opposition for opposition s sake The churlish contribution from the hon and learned Member for Harborough It being one and a half hours after the commencement of proceedings Mr Speaker pursuant to Order put forthwith the Question already proposed from the Chair Question accordingly agreed to Lords amendment agreed to Mr Speaker then proceeded to put forthwith the Questions necessary for the disposal of the business to be concluded at that hour Lords amendment No 21 disagreed to Government amendment a in lieu of Lords amendment No 21 agreed to Lords amendments Nos 20 and 23 agreed to

Yes I know that from going down North Road to the railway station to get to London It takes a long time to get down there so the congestion must be relieved On the railway infrastructure there has been talk about the Leamside line which runs down to Tursdale just north of Ferryhill which is in my constituency There has been talk of refurbishing that line for decades now I remember it being discussed back in the 1980s To refurbish that route would alleviate a lot of pressure on the east coast main line and help to ensure that commuters can get from the Tyne to the Tees and vice versa It could also lead to the reopening of a station at Ferryhill which closed many years ago and which commuters could use to get to both the Tyne and the Tees It would also help the local economy in Ferryhill Hitachi the rail builders are in my constituency Although HS2 is a controversial project Hitachi has been shortlisted to build the rolling stock which is a 2 billion plus contract and will create a lot of jobs for the local area That is important for the north east and we should not forget it The actual factory has brought train building full circle Locomotion No 1 was assembled there back in 1825 and the company is now building the bimodal trains The Government asked for those trains to be built because they knew that electrification of the railway would not go forward in the way that we expected The last matter I want to mention is Durham Tees Valley Airport which is also in my constituency Owned by Peel Airports it has been through troubled times over the past few years It only has two routes now to Schiphol and to Aberdeen Peel wants to ensure that the airport can be kept open into the future The newly elected Conservative mayor of Tees Valley says that he wants to nationalise the airport A few months ago I asked the Transport Secretary about the plans for nationalising regional airports and he said that there were not any which I found interesting as it was the main campaign issue for the Conservative mayor Questions need to be asked If the Minister has had discussions perhaps he can help us What kind of nationalisation are we talking about Is it state owned nationalisation or a workers co operative Are we talking about socialism in one airport or is this a Trojan horse Is it a transitional demand that would lead to the full nationalisation of all the regional airports in the country We need answers today Maybe the main thing that should be considered for Durham Tees Valley airport is a third runway at Heathrow We need investment in the north east because we have a lot to say but we need the transport infrastructure to spread the news

I would add to what the right hon Gentleman says by saying that Northern Ireland provides a home base for 19 Light Brigade which is greatly appreciated We will get the talent that we need in the armed forces only if people think it is an organisation that has a future in which they can build their careers and to which they can make a real contribution That impacts not only on welfare provision soldiers are interested in that but they are also interested in the kind of organisation that they are joining They want to join capable armed forces Planning properly for the future to ensure that they can fulfil a role is the biggest single contribution we can make to attracting the talent we need

It is a pleasure to have such a long time in which to debate this subject I had not expected that Free fruit and vegetables such as carrots have been provided for all infant age children in English schools since the end of 2004 The introduction of the service followed pilots in 2000 and 2001 showing minimal delivery problems strong support from children and staff and even stronger support for the scheme as part of teaching children about healthy eating I shall expand on the nature of the scheme and on how it relates to the educational process and goes beyond health The social process of distributing the fruit and eating it collectively was thought valuable and there was a reported improvement in the ethos and atmosphere in classes Straddling the introduction of the national scheme a major research project was undertaken based on a large sample of schools in 2003 2004 and 2005 It showed predictably that fruit consumption rose among those in the scheme and fell back once children ceased to qualify effectively to the level of the control group who had never been in the scheme Sadly it also showed that children from deprived areas consumed less fruit than those in more affluent areas even when it was available However a similar increase in consumption occurred while they were in the scheme Research by the National Foundation for Educational Research published in 2007 showed a material increase in the proportion of children consuming five portions of fruit and vegetables a day but also showed that a pupil in year 3 the year immediately after the scheme ends was less than half as likely to consume five portions a day as a younger child Since laudably the Government have also been supporting improvements in school meals it is hard to separate the benefits in terms of overall consumption of fruit and vegetables of the fruit scheme from those of other activities that the Government have supported but the research suggested that those eating school meals as opposed to packed lunches were benefiting most It was also clear that the full benefits of dietary change in combating obesity would occur only if fruit and vegetable consumption was substituted for consumption of sweets and desserts It was not clear that that was happening In other words children were often consuming the extra fruit and vegetables at school but not necessarily cutting out the sweets and other items available to them The full benefit of the additional fruit and vegetables was therefore not being felt It should not need to be explained why we should be interested in this issue Fruit and vegetables provide critical vitamin and fibre intake for the body Obesity in children both limits their ability to participate fully in school and threatens their health in the longer term The staff of my hon Friend the Minister will have been able to trace a chain of questions that I have asked since 2007 She nods in assent Why have I been interested Naturally the health policy arguments are persuasive anyway but I was struck by something else it is remarkable how popular this scheme is in schools and how easily and efficiently it works Let me give an example Last Friday I visited one of the smallest primary schools in my constituency in the village of Shardlow I did not mention that I would be raising this topic in the House In fact as the Minister knows I did not know that I would be raising it because the subject of my motion has changed However quite unprompted the head mentioned the popularity of the scheme in the school She said that it was one of the Government s great successes in education I have visited schools in which the scheme has been worked into classroom activities and integrated in the work of catering staffs where they exist In some of the small primary schools in my constituency there is no kitchen but in many there is and there is an opportunity to bring the work of the catering staff into the school My constituency recently produced the school cook of the year It has a strong track record in school catering which as I have mentioned is closely related to this area of policy of producing better nutritional standards for schools There are regular references by head teachers and other staff to the scheme being a shared social activity Eating fruit is a popular activity that can be linked to important subjects such as sharing and to getting across the nutritional content of fruit while relating that to other parts of the school curriculum Among many schemes that are seen by some to have burdened schools and to have had relatively limited effect this is a shining star So when the European Union published a proposal to support a Europe wide school fruit scheme stretching beyond our own and covering children up to the age of 10 I was delighted Surely that would provide an additional incentive to extend the UK scheme The total costs of extending the scheme to all primary age children would be 84 million a year according to a parliamentary answer given late last year That would roughly double the cost of the scheme which costs around 43 million now The European Union has set aside an indicative sum of just over 11 million for UK participation in the scheme As is normal the EU insists that any funding it provides be matched the money cannot be used to replace existing Government funding The marginal cost to the Department depending on the use of the funding by the other authorities within the UK an excellent Scottish scheme broadly parallels the English version would be a little over 30 million For the health impact that that would have on millions of children the associated educational benefits and perhaps this is one of the origins of the European interest in this issue the impact on the horticulture sector in this country it seems a startling bargain We would have difficulty making an administrative mess all the key structures and supply chains are already there and working effectively The reason why the head at Shardlow drew this to my attention was that the delivery man had just arrived with the fruit It was greeted with enthusiasm and he was asking for directions to a nearby school The quality of the fruit was excellent and the scheme is popular with children I have often asked the children which is the most popular fruit Apparently tomatoes are mentioned although not enthusiastically carrots are not enthusiastically eaten by tiny children and apples and bananas are very popular It is all working something that cannot often be said of Government initiatives We can build on it and we know it works Little can go wrong In policy terms it is called low hanging fruit an easy target for policy development It seemed so obvious to me that I assumed that the Government were keen to press ahead too with extending the age range but extracting answers about our intentions once the EU decided to proceed 12 months ago has been hard In July this year a parliamentary answer from my hon Friend the Minister of State referred to a number of pilots and evaluation projects currently under way that are looking at the school fruit and vegetable scheme However when I asked when those might be completed my hon Friend replied that there were no current pilots Among the questions that I would like my hon Friend to address is how this seeming confusion arose I can speculate The scheme is very popular in schools The Scottish Executive commissioned research that found that it was one of the most successful initiatives of its kind with the only reservation being mine that it did not cover more children The scheme has strong support from horticultural interests which could be a reason for the EU s enthusiasm as agricultural interests are much more closely aligned with the political process in the EU Yet the English scheme lies within the budget of the Department of Health which inherited it from the lottery I sense a policy orphan a policy not invented here and not fitting precisely the strategies defined by the Department s team I have found a similar attitude locally It is a nice scheme which we are happy to see continue but we are rather more enthusiastic about other strategies for dealing with child nutrition and obesity Some of the examples in Derbyshire are focused on the extremity of need in children on the very obese and those with severe problems with the nutritional content of their food Those are highly expensive and focused programmes that are needed in many ways but cannot be seen as comparable to the universal fruit and vegetable scheme I would not argue that the school fruit and vegetable scheme is more than a part of a strategy for addressing the health of our primary age children Better school meals stronger advice and labelling I support a more aggressive approach to that for children s food the promotion of physical activity and support for parents through initiatives such as Sure Start which help build solid foundations for feeding children appropriately all play an important part

I am grateful to my right hon Friend for his intervention All opinion polls show that when asked which issues concern them most only 8 per cent of people say that they are worried about the allowances of Members of Parliament When they are asked about their specific Member of Parliament only 4 per cent disapprove of what he or she is doing I concur entirely with my right hon Friend that a period of silence from all party leaders would be helpful because they have not helped in fact they have weakened the institution of Parliament which seeks to hold the Executive to account If I may say so I do so with some reluctance I believe that other people in positions of seniority in the House might also feel that we should leave those matters to IPSA The leader of the Liberal Democrats talked about electoral reform another topic that will rise in the political scene as we approach a general election We live in the modern era and my right hon Friend the Member for Norwich South Mr Clarke also referred to electoral reform so it is clear that it is a major issue that we will have to face at some time However the essence of electoral reform is not only to bring us closer to our constituents and citizens but to ensure that the House maintains its sovereign authority In speaking about today s Gracious Speech my right hon Friend the Prime Minister referred to Iran Iraq and Afghanistan as well as many other world issues and the right hon Member for Penrith and The Border talked about Copenhagen Those are the major issues of our time and they can be dealt with in this House by hon Members holding the Executive to account As the right hon and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe noted the more we weaken the institution the more we remove its powers and the weaker we become the less able we will be to represent our constituents and look after their interests If we are to go down the road of electoral reform it is extremely important that this institution is strengthened I know that my right hon Friend the Member for West Dunbartonshire John McFall is following my speech with the greatest care as I followed his He made a number of statements that of course I fully accept and support He talked about big government being followed by little government and that reminded me of a conversation that I had many years ago with Sheikh Yamani the oil sheikh out of Saudi Arabia who said that if a person has one leg in ice water it does not help him much to put the other one in boiling water Big government may not be the flavour of the day but that does not mean that little government will be better We must be very careful about moving from one extreme to another

The Foreign Secretary referred to several matters and I will start with the Irish question We are intimately bound up with where Europe as a whole goes and whether that involves the European Union as devised by the Lisbon treaty or by its godfather the constitutional treaty is another question Sometimes for better sometimes for worse we have had an intimate relationship over an extremely long period of time with the Irish My grandmother for example was an Irish lady from County Cork There are intimate family and commercial relationships that go back over many hundreds of years One of my forebears was responsible for the petition for Ireland in the 19th century and another was the Member for County Meath in the 1840s and 1850s and was responsible for setting up the tenant rights association Many hon Members have intimate relationships with the Irish people The Irish people voted by a substantial majority against endorsing the Lisbon treaty We have heard in this debate and formerly that the French and the Dutch both turned down the original constitutional treaty Surprise surprise when countries of that size turn down a treaty the treaty is abandoned and a new one is devised In this case I choose my words carefully the Irish are effectively as they were with the Nice treaty being put through the wringer despite the fact that the draft conclusions leave that issue blank at the moment There has been a concerted attempt in which this Government have joined to their eternal shame to bully the Irish people but the Irish people are not prone to being bullied The Government of Ireland are deeply unpopular Under their tutelage the Irish economy is showing signs of being in desperate straits The attempts to bribe the Irish electorate by giving them a free vote on issues relating to abortion providing flexibility within the treaty arrangements or obtaining an extra commissioner who would of course only be a minor voice in EU affairs will get nowhere President Clinton s comment It s the economy stupid may mean this is quite apart from the Irish people s patriotic view as expressed in a recent opinion poll that they will defend their position that the Irish people continue to vote no we will see but that is my judgment Only a couple of days ago the Irish had yet another poll Far from the position getting better from the Irish Government s point of view it is getting worse opposition is now up to 57 per cent The Government are not on a good wicket in joining the rest of the EU to bully our friends comrades and colleagues in the Irish Republic

My hon Friend is right to raise the issue of non tariff barriers The World Trade Organisation itself identified that there were 300 non tariff barriers in 2010 and the figure rose to 1 200 by 2015 Does she agree that Great Britain can be a strong advocate of free trade in the WTO and can try to drive a reduction in not only tariffs but non tariff barriers

I congratulate the hon Member for Mid Derbyshire Mrs Latham on a very evidence based thought provoking and powerful speech The tone of today s debate has in fact been sombre and evidence based There is a strong message for Ministers this is the reality of cuts We can bandy numbers and arguments across the Dispatch Box all we like but this is the reality that schools are facing There are facts there are figures and there are numbers and they represent the reality of people s lives and the reality of the cuts in our constituencies The debate is timely for me because a number of parents have come to my surgeries and expressed great concern about school cuts and a large number of head teachers and governors have come to me in groups to tell me about the distress that they feel because they cannot continue to deliver the standard of education that they have been used to delivering and that our children need I commend the primary schools in Redcar and Cleveland which are among the best in the country I particularly congratulate St Bede s Catholic Primary School in Marske and all the parents staff and children on being named by The Times as the best state primary school in the country That is a phenomenal achievement but all the schools in my area particularly the primaries are finding it increasingly difficult to deliver the standard that children need against a backdrop of cuts According to the School Cuts website Redcar and Cleveland s budget will have been reduced by 4 3 million in real terms between 2015 and 2020 That is a per pupil loss of 226 I hear grumbling about the statistics from the Government Front Bench Let me set out the reality of what this means to our schools Teachers and heads in my constituency are going above and beyond to try to ensure that the children are not affected by the scale of the cuts It epitomises the quality care and passion of our staff that they are willing to do these things to try to make sure the cuts are absorbed and the children are not affected In one school a member of staff has suggested that staff should be regraded for one day a week graded down from their actual worth value and achievement to make savings in staffing costs Two staff members who are eligible to apply to go through the pay threshold suggested they would not apply to do so because they did not want the school budget to increase Support staff have had their hours cut by an average of five hours per week That might not sound like a huge cut but these support staff have on average contracts of only 15 hours a week so they are losing a third of their week s pay Local churches have been donating money from their charities to help fund curriculum budgets not little extras but curriculum budgets an area in which schools have had to make large cuts Teachers tell us about the voluntary help they receive in the classroom people giving up their time free of charge Without that voluntary work they would not be able to deliver the best teaching practice and would therefore be failing our children We are reliant on the voluntary sector I do not think this is what David Cameron s big society was supposed to be doing replacing and enabling the fundamental education of our children in schools Governors have told me they are concerned that next year things will be even worse as they will have to find extra resources to fund additional pension payments and in all likelihood that will lead to reductions in teaching staff I was also struck to the core as I was leaving one of the meetings when I was told that one of the headteachers in my area had to make a member of the cleaning staff redundant to meet the budget that year but was very upset about it and realised that this just was not practical safe and hygienic and he is now paying that member of the cleaning staff from his own salary That is a ridiculous situation for us to be in in this country and it is clear that the cuts are to the bone now and schools cannot continue to provide the kind of service they want to offer I also want to briefly talk in the time allocated to me about SEND special educational needs and disability education as there has been a huge increase in demand for that in my local area and there is real and deep concern Nationally demand for services for children and young people with SEND has increased by 35 in just the last four years that is a huge increase but there has not been the budget to cover it We are seeing now the reality of that in our constituencies affecting our children A recent Local Government Association survey of local authorities found that councils fund support for nearly 320 000 children with complex needs and disabilities but are facing a funding gap of almost 500 million That gap has been plugged by taking funding from elsewhere in schools as we have heard and by drawing down reserves The National Association of Head Teachers has published the results of a survey on SEND showing that only 2 of respondents said the top up funding they received was sufficient to meet individual education health and care plan statements while 94 of respondents were finding it harder to resource the support required to meet the needs of pupils with SEND and 73 said it was harder to resource support for pupils with SEND due to cuts to mainstream funding This is the reality of what we are seeing vulnerable children who need the most help and support to enable them to flourish and fulfil their potential are those most let down by these cuts That is balancing the books on the backs of the children who need the most help and support to flourish I also want to briefly mention children s services because as my hon Friend the Member for Hackney South and Shoreditch Meg Hillier mentioned wider cuts are having a knock on effect as well Pressure is building right across education and children s services In Redcar and Cleveland our children s services have a 4 2 million overspend The number of looked after children is almost double what it was five years ago and that is alongside the cuts of 90 million that Redcar and Cleveland has seen to its budget which means it now has a 4 2 million overspend Ofsted s 2017 18 annual report commented on a sharp increase in recent years in demand for assessments to be carried out as well as a growing number of refusals by local authorities to do so and raised concerns about increasing numbers of children awaiting provision despite having a plan in place In 2018 2 000 children with a statement were awaiting provision almost three times more than in 2010 The tone of today s debate has been positive constructive and thoughtful We all want the same end we all want our children to have the best start in life to flourish and to have everything they need from their years in school but the reality is this cannot happen without funding and the reality is that the funding formulas we have are not working The support is not there our schools are being cut to the bone and I urge the Government to do more to make sure every child can fulfil their potential

I am grateful for being allowed to intervene on the hon Gentleman The point that Government Members are making is simply that we have heard a very long speech about systemic pension risk That may be an issue but it could be an issue for another occasion The Select Committees produced a worthy report of more than 60 pages specifically about BHS I am relieved that the hon Gentleman is actually addressing BHS the employees who have lost their jobs and the pensioners who have been left with less benefits than they should rightly have expected I am delighted he is finally getting to that part of his speech We look forward to the rest of it

Dr Paul Miller the new BMA consultant negotiator has today called for a resumption of national contract talks saying that the consultants Xare becoming increasingly frustrated at the slow pace of change The Government is quick to claim credit for reductions in the longest patient waits but slower to acknowledge that the long waits have simply moved further down the system with more patients waiting between six and 12 months for treatment How can the Government hope to gain the trust of the consultants when they are responsible for this sort of systemic distortion

It is a pleasure to follow the hon Member for Stretford and Urmston Kate Green and I congratulate her on her new role as Chair of the Committee on Standards Having served as a member of Parliament for only a year and a half I did wonder whether it was appropriate for me to speak in this debate I personally have not witnessed many of the things described in the report However I do have prior experience of managing thousands of people from different backgrounds and cultures in large companies for more than 27 years so I might be able to provide some useful insights into industry best practice I completely agree with the comments made by my hon Friend the Member for Shipley Philip Davies that many companies have gone through this culture change and that we can learn a lot from them As a new MP however I can safely say that Parliament is very different from any workplace I have ever seen and it has a very distinct culture Parliament is effectively a common workplace for what are in reality 650 separate small businesses each with their own leadership and teams This is unusual and it is probably one of the reasons why this issue has not been effectively tackled earlier There is no real central control and certainly no central HR support The reputation of Parliament is vital because we have the responsibility to pass legislation not least employment law itself Dame Laura Cox s report shows us beyond all doubt that our present approach is not working It is letting staff down and we need to change So what does good look like in the workplace and how can we achieve it Based on my experience and on the valuable insights I have received from professional organisations such as the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development I believe that we need to approach our get well strategy under two headings preventing bullying and harassment from happening in the first place and dealing with them decisively when they do happen Our prevention approach needs to start at the top by which I mean all of us elected representatives as well as senior managers in the House of Commons administration We need to show that we are serious about tackling this issue and that means that we as Members of Parliament should lead by example and personally demonstrate the right behaviours and attend training programmes and awareness raising events Best practice would include monitoring attendance at such events and even publishing a list of those MPs who are and are not attending them or as happens in the workplace completing online educational work modules That is usual practice in other industries If we conduct ourselves in this way we can start to shift the culture away from where it is now towards a more inclusive diverse and respectful workplace Turning to the subject of what to do when it is alleged that bullying or harassment may have taken place we should again follow best practice with a simple well understood consistent confidential independent and above all fast escalation process There are some existing policies in this area but the Cox report clearly states that they are overly complex and do not enjoy the confidence of our colleagues working in Parliament In order to cleanse the system we need to show that we take the issue seriously acting when required with full transparency and we must be seen to do that

The hon Gentleman is being generous in giving way and I appreciate it Does he agree that the Bill throws into question the entire relationship between the Freedom of Information Act and the Data Protection Act I have correspondence from many constituents who have sought information under the Freedom of Information Act and been denied it because of the provisions of the Data Protection Act The primacy of data protection has always been the essential element in public bodies responses to their requests Today are we not throwing into question the protection that the Data Protection Act provides and putting in the minds of other public authorities the notion that perhaps they should be handing out information that the Data Protection Act does not provide such restrictions Will not many people in many circumstances now be exposed to genuine risk

To measure the total number of courses is a very poor indicator of success in this respect It is quite ridiculous to say that a one or two year course leading to a vocational qualification at level 2 or level 3 should be given the same weighting as a four or six week short course undertaken with great satisfaction but purely for the joy of learning We have done exactly the right thing by emphasising spending on those parts of education that equip people with the basics to get on in society and the skills in order to participate in work To take the total figure of funded short informal adult education courses and to ignore all the other education funded by the Government and the progress on work based learning is wrong

The right hon Gentleman is of course correct to say that getting rid of Gaddafi is not part of resolution 1973 but the resolution that preceded it resolution 1970 which provides for the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to investigate crimes against humanity in Libya could easily bring about the arrest and incarceration of Colonel Gaddafi under international law Does the right hon Gentleman agree that we need to factor that into our strategy

I am grateful to the Minister for giving way but it does stink a bit of pot and kettle for her to claim that every party but hers is all over the place on this issue If we are honest there are divisions in all parties just as there are in the country Frankly I do not agree with her argument that democracy is static It is a dynamic thing and there is no reason why people should not change their views as facts change May I ask the Minister about one particular fact I am surprised that no one has taken her up on it Can she please tell us what the resolution is to the Irish border issue She wrongly stated that it had been resolved at the December Council It was not What is the solution to avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland The Under Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union the hon Member for Worcester Mr Walker who is sitting next to her shakes his head Maybe he can get up and tell us what the resolution is to this issue

I think that I will be the last person this evening to make their maiden speech No I am sorry I stand corrected I am the penultimate person to do so Having grown up in Falmouth and having been confirmed in Truro cathedral it is a real privilege to stand here today as the first MP for the new constituency of Truro and Falmouth I am particularly pleased to join today s debate in which we are discussing the important contribution that many of the measures in the Budget will make in enabling enterprise to prosper in my constituency My immediate predecessors will be well known to Members of this House Matthew Taylor served for more than 20 years as the Member for Truro and St Austell and he played an important role in highlighting the issues of living and working in the countryside of Cornwall in his well respected Taylor report As chairman of the National Housing Federation and a director of South West Water as well as serving in the House of Lords as a Lib Dem peer he will be able to continue his work on the issues identified in his report I look forward to helping him to take the words from its pages and put them into action especially in delivering truly affordable homes for local people to buy or rent Julia Goldsworthy served as the Member for Falmouth and Camborne in the last Parliament and she has recently returned to the Westminster to work as special adviser to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury Her work in creating the Sustainable Communities Act 2007 is noteworthy as is her dedicated campaigning work for NHS services in Cornwall I look forward to working with her in her new role I have often heard colleagues in this House refer to Cornwall as part of the Celtic fringe no doubt that is intended in a humorous way While I am very proud of the Celtic culture sports and traditions of Cornwall there is absolutely nothing fringe about Cornwall or its people Cornwall throughout the ages has been and will continue to be at the cutting edge of important national developments as well as being at the centre of key moments of our history The industrial revolution started in Cornwall and Cornwall is leading the new industrial revolution that of delivering the renewable and sustainable energy that our future economic security and growth will depend upon Cornwall s pioneering and inventive people and enterprises are ready to rise to the challenge of delivering a low carbon economy and secure energy supplies They need a Government who understand how to create the right market conditions for enterprise to succeed I believe that this coalition Government have the determination to do this and so to unlock potential in Cornwall My constituency is a slice of central Cornwall running from the north to the south coasts It includes Cornwall s administrative retail and media centre and its only city Truro The Royal Cornwall hospital the only acute hospital in the whole county is in Truro along with the Peninsula medical and dental school I am grateful for the dedication of the staff in our NHS in Cornwall and the people who work hard in all our public services Cornwall has benefited from EU objective 1 funding and now convergence funding which has helped to develop the knowledge based economy Combined Universities in Cornwall has enabled people of all ages to access the opportunity to undertake higher education and obtain new skills University College Falmouth is a world leading arts organisation Throughout the constituency are very many beautiful villages from the rugged splendour of the north coast villages of St Agnes and Perranporth to the no less beautiful but gentler coastline of the Roseland peninsula As hon Members will be aware tourism is an important industry in Cornwall Thanks to local farmers and fishermen there is a thriving and growing local food scene which comes together into some mouth watering food festivals enjoyed by locals and tourists alike I am delighted that the new coalition Government recognise the importance of farming and fishing to our national food security In the hinterlands of the constituency are the ruins of many of the mines for which Cornwall is famous As a descendant of Cornish miners I am particularly pleased to see renewable energy enterprises developing in the ruins of the old tin and copper mines Cornwall has the hottest rocks in the UK and is a natural location for geothermal energy production That combined with our rich tradition of engineering and inventiveness provides an ideal environment and ideal skills to develop that sustainable form of energy Geothermal Engineering Ltd has submitted a popularly backed planning application to Cornwall council and if it is successful we will see the first commercial geothermal energy plant in the UK which will produce 10 MW of renewable energy to be fed into the national grid Nearby at the former mine of Mount Wellington is Kensa Engineering an award winning manufacturer of ground heat pumps that works with social housing providers across the country to deliver low carbon energy and at the same time lift people out of fuel poverty I am delighted that the coalition Government have stated their support for renewable energy incentives I believe that the Government s priority as set out in the Budget to enable more business finance and financial support for the low carbon economy will help support excellent low carbon companies and energy providers such as those in my constituency The Government s emphasis on the need for economic growth to come from the private sector will also I believe create a better environment for the many businesses that already contribute so much to the local economy particularly at Falmouth port Falmouth is not only important to the economy of Cornwall as the third largest natural harbour in the world it is of strategic importance to the UK Falmouth has a long and proud maritime history and as the most westerly port in the Atlantic gateway has been at the centre of trade since ancient times As ships for all purposes including those needed to service marine renewables and the Navy are getting larger the deep waters of that safe haven are ever more important to the nation not just to Cornwall I understand that many of the measures in the Budget will be tough for people living and working in my constituency I do however believe that by taking the brave decisions in this Budget

I am grateful to the hon Gentleman who refers to the debate on the police last Friday in which many hon Members wanted to speak I sat for three and a half or four hours but remained the only hon Member not called to speak The hon Gentleman said at the time helpfully that I should not worry as I could always give the speech on another occasion This is that other occasion and I thank the hon Gentleman very much for his help The problem of graffiti is difficult In Croydon we are making some headway through the use of closed circuit television A strategy of bang em down and lock em up is not always appropriate By ensuring that the youth service and the police service work hand in hand we can take a CCTV video of a youth spraying graffiti to his parents We can then say Here s Johnny doing this Unless you get him to clean that off with the council we ll take him to court We do not want to force people into the judicial system and the university of crime We want them to face up to the consequences of their mischief and clean up the graffiti That is happening and it is working Drug use is a massive cause of crime and a massive problem in prison Croydon is running a treatment and testing pilot scheme Instead of going to jail people given treatment and testing orders have training and education for five days a week and are tested for drugs If they are not clean they go to prison Most of these people have been in prison and know how awful it is The scheme is keeping people out of prison and helping them to stop their habit In prison they would continue taking drugs because it is easy to get them The scheme is working very well I understand that in Birmingham intensive supervision and surveillance programmes that are an alternative to prison are working remarkably well They give people back their self esteem by investing in education giving them work habits and getting them back into normal life We should be considering that sort of programme

As I said Oxford already has a growth deal There is considerable scope within that to allocate funds to cycling if the local authority so wishes I have not met this cycling champion I did not know of the Oxford cycling champion s existence so they might not have been quite as high profile as Oxford might like However they are welcome to come and talk to me about their priorities and we can discuss them as I have done with metro Mayors and other key figures around the country in this area The hon Lady focuses on Oxford and rightly so but it is also important to mention Milton Keynes as well as Cambridge as this report covers all three areas According to the 2016 Active Lives survey the local authorities with the highest prevalence of adults cycling at least once a week were Cambridge at 54 followed by Oxford at 37 and then South Cambridgeshire The figures compare to a national average of 11 9 so these are vanguard authorities that are thinking about how they can take their measures forward From a Government standpoint I have talked about the growth in city deals but it is also important to flag that in addition to the moneys that were discussed in 2017 since the strategy was launched the Department has also announced considerable amounts of additional funding potentially available This includes the 1 7 million transforming cities fund of which as the hon Member for Oxford West and Abingdon will know 250 million has been provided for Manchester of which 160 million will be used for the Chris Boardman cycling and walking scheme We are providing 77 million for local road schemes that support cycling and walking projects through the national productivity investment fund 30 million to improve road and cycle safety for cyclists and pedestrians along the HS2 route and 220 million of capital and revenue funding through the clean air fund of the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs The hon Lady rightly asked how this all pans out The answer is that these pots of money are available for different authorities to bid for as they bid for them so the allocations are made It is impossible to say in advance what the allocations will be but we can give a retrospective account of the funds that have been delivered It is important to try to balance a national strategy with specific opportunities to improve and respond to local leadership in particular areas Colleagues know that I take cycle safety and the safety of vulnerable road users extremely seriously The point made by Andrew Gilligan and by the hon Lady a point that has been made many many times is the importance not merely of improving safety but of doing so through segregated infrastructure and that is a very well taken point One does not have to look at all far even in this country let alone to the countries of Europe that are very advanced in terms of cycling to see the effect Earlier this year we published a call for evidence on cycling and walking safety We have had 13 000 responses and the Department will publish a summary of those shortly Before the end of the year I plan to set out the final findings from the review A lot of attention is focused on some changes we are making to the treatment of offences by cyclists but the focus of the review overwhelmingly will be on improving safety of cyclists and pedestrians and on setting the terms for an expansion of cycling and walking to combat some of the concerns about obesity and air quality that we have described It is important to recognise that even without that the Department has taken an important wide range of interim steps We have given over 7 million of funding to local authorities to support safety improvements including over 500 000 worth of improvements to the Fendon Road roundabout in Cambridge We have launched a new UK wide initiative to help the police to crack down on close passing which we have taken seriously in central Government for the first time We have announced a 1 million sponsorship agreement between the Bikeability Trust and Halfords We are taking measures to improve standards for infrastructure and to incorporate guidance on close passing into the Highway Code as well as supporting pathfinder projects to upgrade the national cycle network There is a wide range of different measures with much of the focus on infrastructure but obviously we would like to go considerably further I am very pleased that 18 million of Cambridge s city deal funding since 2015 has been spent on new cycling infrastructure with a further 50 million committed to 2021 Cambridge and Oxford alas not Milton Keynes are among the eight cities that the Government have supported through the 191 million Cycle Ambition Cities programme That shows our desire to reinforce the success that they have had and to try to give additional support In thinking about this kind of infrastructure development we have tried to respond to specific initiatives Oxfordshire County Council has put forward a proposal entitled Oxfordshire Innovation Corridor which will receive a lot of attention We take these issues very seriously I congratulate the hon Member for Oxford West and Abingdon on calling this debate Question put and agreed to House adjourned

The hon and learned Gentleman makes a fine point The purpose of my amendment which I shall not press to a Division is to probe the Government s thinking Other suggestions for amendments were made in Committee and some of those might reflect the judgments given in Reynolds more closely than paragraph g Any decisions by lower courts can be appealed but going all the way to the Supreme Court is very time consuming and expensive The purpose of my amendment 10 is therefore to get the Government to clarify what they mean by paragraph g and whether they have fully taken into account the most up to date case law and to give them the opportunity to state to the House that there is no intention that the clause should be at odds in any way with how the responsible journalism defence has been developed by the courts over the years Amendment 11 which relates to sub section 2 h simply reflects the actual wording used by Lord Nicholls in his list in the Reynolds case in which the court considered whether a newspaper might reasonably have delayed publication for instance to wait longer for a comment from the subject of an article rather than going to press when it did The concern in the legal profession about the current wording of sub section 2 h is that it is neutral and does not capture the essence of the urge or the urgency to publish It is a concern for weekly fortnightly or monthly publications for example that withholding a comment can be used to try to ensure that a story does not appear in a particular edition I shall pray the noble Lord Lester in aid again Urgency appears explicitly in his list of factors that the courts may take into account In his private Member s Bill he proposed that they may consider whether there were any factors supporting urgent publication Amendment 12 is lifted word for word from Lord Lester It is intentionally broader than amendment 3 which my hon Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington John McDonnell will speak to shortly It also seeks to address a concern that was not addressed in Committee Following the phone hacking affair and the failure yet again by certain aggressive tabloids to put their own house in order there is now a crisis of confidence in the press in this country The Press Complaints Commission palpably failed over phone hacking and in cases such as that of the McCanns It is broken and the son of PCC advanced by the industry to replace it looks all too much like the PCC itself The mantra in the industry often seems to have been never to let the editors code of practice get in the way of a good story or good business I am sure that when Lord Justice Leveson reports next month he will make similar damning judgments about the practices of the press or certain parts of it The amendment seeks to give statutory recognition if that is the right word when newspapers are seeking to rely on qualified privilege to the importance of journalists following a relevant code of practice be it their own publication s code the editors code one from a regulator or that of the profession It also seeks to bolster the position of journalists They are frequently asked by editors to do things that breach those codes Leave your morals at home or you ll be colouring in the black squares on the crossword before we sack you can instil genuine fear in many parts of the industry Only editors and proprietors have been consulted on the proposals for the reform of the PCC journalists have not I believe that in striving for better quality journalism we should give good codes of practice more weight The amendment seeks to do that

My right hon Friend makes an important point He talked about it in the context of health but we could apply it to the spending of many other Departments He is absolutely right that as we allocate this new spending especially if it is multi year funding amounting to billions of pounds it is imperative that we make sure every penny is spent wisely That work is done jointly with the Department but also in a unit in the Treasury We will have a laser like focus on efficiency and if we need to take action we will not hesitate

The hon Gentleman makes an interesting point It may well be the case that the specific mechanism of the levy control framework relates to meeting that target As I have said I am not sure that the framework as it stands addresses the target in the way we might think Nevertheless in order to achieve the target those companies investing in new renewable low carbon plants offshore wind and all sorts of other low carbon arrangements that are at the heart of the Bill have to start on the work now on projects that will come on stream in six seven eight nine and 10 years time However those companies which are at heart of the engine of this Bill will not do that under the current circumstances because they have to take decisions now and if they see that they will face a cliff face of some height in 2020 they may well decide that they do not want to use their initial investments for that purpose because there will be no business for them after that time I have a specific example which the hon Gentleman has prompted me to give I recently visited Vestas offshore wind research and development centre on the Isle of Wight The centre is researching the future of the next generation of Vestas offshore wind blades and other mechanisms It is researching among other things 80 metre blades and doing a great deal of stress testing and research and development and in the process it is fabricating those blades As a result the centre has in place on the Isle of Wight a single line manufacturing capacity that could produce a large number of 80 metre offshore blades in the UK If nothing happens after 2020 we should bear in mind that making blades as close as possible to large offshore developments is significantly commercially advantageous it is extremely unlikely that Vestas will change its R and D facility to a production facility because it will not make blades in this country for development in the south China seas That could lead to the development of a UK offshore wind industry being based on no supply chain whatsoever because in order to carry out developments we would have to source from elsewhere That would be of considerable expense to consumers which would not be the case if we adopted a longer term approach The oddity of there not being a target in the Bill raises questions about the strategy to create certainty for the process by which the new form of low carbon energy market will be brought into being The idea of enacting the Bill without including a target is bizarre but that is the position we are in Including a target would not just be the right thing to do it would be a practical element of what the Bill is about It would also be a practical way of ensuring that electricity market reform and the Bill itself work There are a number of reasons to support the inclusion of a target and the final bizarre thing to note is that a large number of hon Members present know that to be the case and want the Bill to include a target A number of hon Members may decide for all sorts of reasons that it is expedient not to vote for a target If that is the case let me be clear that they will undermine the very purpose of the Bill They will also undermine what we all voted for with regard to the Climate Change Act 2008 which ensured that we can reach our low carbon future in a coherent and controlled way using the best of our resources and technology and our supply chains and developing a low carbon economy that can reach the targets in a way that is good for the consumer and for society This is that important That is why I hope that hon Members who may be equivocating over whether to go for the deals the Faustian pacts that have caused the Bill to reach its current state will come out in favour of what their own heads tell them namely the logic of including a target to make sure that the Bill is shaped as well as it can be for the future

We absolutely are ensuring that Departments are backing British food For example more than 90 of the dairy products sourced by the Government come from the United Kingdom There are of course some products such as coffee that we cannot yet produce in the UK although now that we are able to produce our own aubergines tomatoes and chillies I am sure we are not far away from that

I agree that oil prices go up and down but when I said that last year during the referendum campaign I was told that I was scaremongering that I was talking Scotland down and that that could not possibly happen The hon Lady should listen to her former leader He told us that the oil price would never drop below 113 a barrel but look what happened a few months later In relation to the oil price I would like to say in passing that whoever is Chancellor in the future will increasingly face a structural problem in the economy North sea oil revenues are not going to return to where they have been for the past 30 years income tax revenues are decreasing corporation tax is proving more and more difficult to get and the Government s ability to collect money through fuel duties is steadily diminishing This is all going to put more pressure on measures such as VAT All Governments are going to have to face these facts and the fall in oil prices brings them into sharp focus The current low levels of productivity are a matter of great concern The Chancellor had a lot of fun comparing Yorkshire and France but French workers are in fact more productive That is not because our workers are lazy or anything like that it is simply because French firms have invested more That is why certainty in public spending is important It is also important that the Government should do those things that the private sector is not going to do For example I have increasing doubts about the ability of the private sector to provide us single handed with the energy generation that we are going to need I am in favour of replacing our nuclear power plants but the proposals for the next nuclear power station are heavily dependent on the French and Chinese Governments and I worry about that I speak as an advocate of the mixed economy but I believe that we now need to ask ourselves whether we have reached a stage at which it might be cheaper and more effective for the Government to be doing more in that regard rather than leaving it to the private sector On transport infrastructure it will I hope be for the next Government finally to make a decision on additional expansion whether at Heathrow or elsewhere in the south east Actually none of those arguments has changed in the 10 years since the last White Paper was published on the subject I also hope that the next Government will take advantage of the present ability to borrow very cheaply by borrowing to invest I personally would spend more time on HS3 than on HS2 but I recognise that I might be in a minority in holding that view on my own side and in the House as a whole To be honest there would be much more benefit particularly to the northern part of England in spending more money on the transport links there than in building a fast link between Birmingham and London However that is something that the next Government are going to have to deal with I speak as a former Secretary of State for Transport The Department for Transport s record on announcing such plans is pretty good but it is not quite so good when it comes to delivering Indeed many announcements were made last week but I distinctly remember announcing the same things myself 10 years ago Perhaps that illustrates the problem that all Governments face One of the profound issues that needs to be discussed as we go into the next election is what people expect the Government to do in regard to the provision of services such as education health and pensions and what sort of society we want to live in However this Budget does not begin to address those questions which is why I shall have no hesitation in supporting my hon and right hon Friends in the Division Lobby tonight

I am sure that that happens It is the opposite problem from the one that I am describing where challenging pupils coming into a borough clearly need extra funding but are not getting it The border schools are therefore seriously under funded and have serious educational difficulties I raised the issue in a debate three years ago with the then Minister for School Standards now the Minister for the Arts She agreed that there was a problem and cited an experimental arrangement in Solihull I think to try to overcome the problem of cross border movement and funding arrangements I urge the Minister to give it his attention The third issue that I shall touch on is the broader philosophy of choice and what it means We have had sufficient examples during the debate to show the ambiguous and confusing way in which the word choice is used Most of us think it means parents on behalf of their children having the right in some sense to choose a school The Conservative spokesman the hon Member for Upminster Angela Watkinson seemed to mean the opposite the school having the right to choose its pupils Even the choice of a school by the parents is an ambiguous concept as we have heard Preference and choice might mean quite different things cross border or not cross border faith or non faith schools for example I agree with the suggestion from my hon Friend the Member for Southwark North and Bermondsey that we need if not standardised systems of admission at least compatible principles The only reasonable arrangement to reconcile the demands of different groups of parents applying for different types of school is a criterion based predominantly on distance and possibly on sibling connection or some mix of those two factors There would be significant drawbacks to any other arrangement such as a lottery it was recently proposed that applicants should be chosen by lot which has enormous disadvantages because it breaks down any sense of geographical identity and greatly adds to transport costs and all the environmental problems associated with that What is needed is a common set of rules based on distance and sibling relationship If that principle were applied much of the sense of injustice would be substantially diminished I shall mention two other points briefly and then allow another hon Member to speak On capital funding I echo the cautionary words of the hon Member for Wimbledon Roger Casale For many years my borough was unable to achieve any capital funding whatever In the Conservative years it was effectively barred With the new Government we have had a considerable amount of capital spending which is welcome but the only basis on which that could be arranged was the private finance initiative No other vehicle was available On a purely pragmatic basis I and my former Lib Dem council welcomed that and worked with the PFI programme It has worked relatively well Schools have been built and they have been completed on time Ours is one of the few boroughs from which Jarvis emerges with a moderate degree of credit but the programme is storing up problems We should be frank about that The hon Gentleman spelled out the problems Many schools have a commitment to a fixed set of repayment obligations amortisation and maintenance costs that will have to be maintained come what may We are currently in a good phase of school funding that may be partly a reflection of the Government s resources being put into schools but there will come a time when schools are seriously squeezed for funding and they will not be able to make any economies on the maintenance side All the cuts will have to come out of teaching I can see the crisis looming ahead Many of our teachers are apprehensive about it It may be useful to hear from the Government how they would deal with the rigidity in the funding of PFI schemes Finally I shall ask the Minister about a sector of education that we have not touched on at all in the debate the pre school sector There is a great deal of emphasis on the early years I strongly support all the research showing how crucial that is to subsequent performance My borough together with Croydon is one of the two that have not complied with Government requirements for free nursery education for three and four year olds What action does the Minister intend to take to make sure that boroughs do comply How does he intend to help them overcome their problem There is a political issue It is a Conservative controlled council so I do not want to make excuses for it but I am told that the council cannot meet the funding requirements for the Government s stipulations Perhaps the Minister will explain the balance of the argument and how the council can be helped or made to comply with the statutory requirements for pre school provision

My hon Friend is absolutely right Those doctors could not be sure and they would not be able to assess the even more subtle internal pressure that an individual might feel to express a wish to end their life because they feel a burden What special procedure is there in the Bill for the particularly vulnerable in our society such as those with mental health or learning difficulties There is none No wonder Mencap and Scope oppose it The hon Member for Wolverhampton South West speaks of multiple safeguards Where are they in the Bill I do not see them Does he mean the provision that the decision should be referred to a High Court judge If this was not so serious it would be laughable The judge would not have to meet the patient they would only have to confirm the doctors decision and in a time frame of 14 days making independent scrutiny all but impossible Absent will be the detailed rigorous examination that the family court gives to life and death issues such as turning off a life support system Gone will be the investigative powers of the Director of Public Prosecutions under the current legislation to rigorously investigate cases of assisted suicide referred to him Removed will be the strong deterrent against malicious behaviour that the current law provides

The hon Gentleman raises a quite reasonable point All over the world we have this problem We need to ensure that banks strengthen their capital position because in the long term that is essential Of course if banks did that and there was no other intervention there would be less credit in the economy and the economy would shrink further The result would be that the bank assets that are currently impaired would become even worse That is why we have not only taken action to recapitalise the banks in the case of RBS and Lloyds Group we have put additional capital in but put in place schemes such as the credit guarantee scheme which is working very well the special liquidity support system which has provided liquidity for the banks and in addition the asset protection scheme which as I have said will go down a similar road to the scheme in the United States I am sure that the hon Gentleman recognises that as he is in a minority in his party in that he sees the point and the reason behind Government intervention in such extraordinary circumstances Government intervention is absolutely necessary to complement the process that he and I agree has to take place if we are to maintain credit in the economy

Companies certainly need to recognise their responsibilities towards the environment the green belt and the planning system It is possible for local planning authorities in England to put conditions on planning permissions and if those conditions are violated it is up to them to take enforcement action

Will my hon Friend join me in welcoming the work of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine which is trying to change the way that emergency medicine consultants work in order to retain more of them in their particular specialty At the moment far too many of them leave that specialty creating some of the problems that we see across the country

My hon Friend makes his point but it would take me rather offline to follow him down that route Let me return to the point about innocence because Ministers now intimate if they do not say so outright that they will pay compensation in cases where innocent people are detained for longer than 28 days Could we ever have a more explicit admission of the inevitable failure of the law or of the foreseeable injustices that it will bring It is for this House to search its conscience to determine whether putting in place a system of six weeks detention when on current experience half or more cases are likely to be proved innocent will serve the vital interests either of our national security or very importantly of British justice

If I may I shall first make some progress The unfairness story has been mentioned but I am surprised that no one has said that the real villain of the piece seems to be France France s gross contributions have been 9 2 billion versus our contribution of 7 3 billion but refunds to France amount to 8 5 billion versus 3 8 billion to us The net effect is that France pays 750 million compared with the United Kingdom s 3 2 billion and Germany s 7 5 billion but the French economy is broadly comparable in size to Britain s That seems to be where the main unfairness lies I was surprised by the enthusiasm for the agreement because surely the disappointment of Berlin was the failure adequately to reform the common agricultural policy I do not understand how central and eastern European countries can join in a hurry until there have been considerably more reforms We have heard comments about the Polish milk situation and we are kidding ourselves if we think that enough has yet been done The iron curtain came down 12 years ago and it is a disgrace that we are still fiddling away and delaying membership for those states I wish to make the fundamental point that the United States which is relatively homogeneous and has a common currency has transfer payments of 11 per cent of GNP Implicit in the arithmetic before us is that 1 27 per cent is economically sufficient for the less homogeneous economies of Europe that also now have a common currency Detailed research does not appear to have been carried out on the fundamental issue of the amount of transfer payments that Europe is likely to need in the future My hon Friend the Member for Hertsmere Mr Clappison made the serious point that administrative costs are rising fast After the major expenditure on the common agricultural policy and the structural moneys there is 12 billion of other EU expenses in the budget of which precious little is seen If 12 billion were spent on education or the health service in this country it would make a colossal difference It may be a small sum in terms of pence per citizen of the EU but that large sum has manifestly not been well spent The Chief Secretary failed to refer to that fact that it was not just the Berlin agreement but as I pointed out the Council decisions of last September relating to contributions and he failed to explain his understanding of what paragraph 16 is all about It does not empower the levying of new European taxes it invites proposals to do so and to review the British abatement yet again Its existence however puts down a pretty important marker for the future The Chief Secretary said that he thought that Berlin had met the key objectives but does he really think that that is true of CAP reforms He also said that the effects on the United Kingdom were neutral but I repeat my question on the significance of the windfall costs My hon Friend the Member for Hertsmere regretted the inadequate reforms to the EU budget generally and made a convincing case that the relative position of Britain will deteriorate a little as the result of Berlin He explained the costs of giving up the windfall and pointed out a small inaccuracy in the Labour manifesto which had claimed that the UK contribution would fall to a level similar to Italy s That is manifestly not the case Despite all the hullabaloo about the CAP and the fact that agricultural spending has stabilised at 45 per cent and is down from the proportionately higher levels of the past my hon Friend pointed out that in absolute terms expenditure is not down much and will rise slightly over the next year or two In essence Conservative Members understand the fairness and approve the shift to GNP but we believe that there has not been enough reform of the CAP and that there could have been a slightly better deal for the United Kingdom The hon Member for Bexleyheath and Crayford surprisingly expressed surprise that the stealth and lack of transparency concerning many EU matters leads people to be cautious and to wonder what is going on That is not surprising and it would be better if communication were much more transparent However it is the objective of EMU to create a European state although not in the traditional sense of the word As all one s continental friends are clear the objectives are not just economic but political The hon Member for Kingston and Surbiton Mr Davey made a gentle conservative speech that left me unclear about where the Liberal Democrats stand on Europe I thought that they were much more enthusiastic than the Labour party for full European integration He said that the Bill is modest and could be expensive for the UK In addition he regretted the fact that there were so few reforms to the CAP Constructively he wanted to repatriate to nation states expenditure that was not core expenditure He also challenged the Chief Secretary s assertion that the CAP reform was radical and adequate We too made that point The hon Member for Broxtowe Dr Palmer criticised us for arguing that administrative expenses were rising by too much He made the silly point that just because it was only a penny or so per person it did not matter The absolute sums are substantial and hon Members on both sides of the House are most critical of the waste in the 12 billion That cannot be overlooked My right hon Friend the Member for Wokingham plagiarised the Prime Minister His contribution can be described as vintage Redwood He made the robust assertion that camouflage is being used because the Bill is supported by an underlying document which at paragraph 16 invites the introduction of direct taxation by the EU and a further reduction in the UK s abatement Even if the net financial deal is collectively reasonable we should not deceive ourselves that the Berlin agreement is to our explicit financial advantage It opens up the unknown which could produce the fifth resource The hon Member for Falkirk East Mr Connarty was keen on central and eastern European membership and enlargement which we support He made the fundamental point that it would strengthen a Europe of democratic nations and make them more outward looking He also made an interesting contribution on tobacco fraud I congratulate my hon Friend the Member for Leominster Mr Wiggin on his excellent maiden speech Having lived in that part of the world I did not know that there had been two Prime Ministers from Leominster What he said about foot and mouth and rural industries was moving and important I hope that the Government will take note of it He also made a significant point about how the CAP contributed towards some of the problems that spread foot and mouth as well as commenting constructively on how it was mishandled The hon Member for Caerphilly Mr David argued that Berlin was good for Europe In particular he argued that it was sensible to have more GNP based finance than VAT based finance However I question his assertion that the CAP has been brought under adequate control I also congratulate my hon Friend the Member for Tatton Mr Osborne on his equally good maiden speech He made an excellent and elegant contribution which demonstrated a gracious handling of his predecessor I mean of course his immediate predecessor The hon Member for South Derbyshire Mr Todd made an interesting contribution arising from his business dealings with the European Commission As a taxpayer he was critical of the waste of money on what he implied were crackpot projects and of excessive nepotism in the awarding of contracts I hope that his comments did not apply to him personally He echoed the point made by my hon Friend the Member for Hertsmere that it is bad news when administrative costs rise at a rate much higher than inflation with no justification I also congratulate the hon Member for Moray Angus Robertson on his maiden speech For those of us who come from south of Watford it was an interesting education on the family background of Scottish nationalism He made the interesting point that if Britain were broken up into separate components we would have more votes in Europe than we do as one country That is not a justification for Scottish independence that particularly appeals to me The hon Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston Mr Miller gave an interesting history of the original abatement negotiations from Ian Gilmour s book He also focused on the EU s ability to tackle fraud but it seemed to me that he too was over optimistic about the likely effects of the reforms to the CAP so far I congratulate my hon Friend the Member for Castle Point Dr Spink on his splendid retread maiden speech I think that that is the correct phrase and welcome him back to the House He pointed out that the Berlin summit missed several opportunities and he gave a vivid vignette of his constituents sound down to earth views which rang extraordinarily true to me being as many will know someone who grew up in the splendid county of Essex The hon Member for Harlow Mr Rammell welcomed an early debate on Europe following the general election but he almost admitted that he knew that his views were not entirely in accordance with those of the majority of his constituents even though he has of course been re elected He said that he understood why a majority of the British people tend to be Euro sceptic in the correct sense of the word My hon Friend the Member for Rochford and Southend East Sir T Taylor made a splendid bluntly persuasive speech during which I observed Labour Members listening intently and I think secretly agreeing with much of what he said He rightly pointed out that there has been no genuine reform of the CAP He has been waiting more than 20 years for that and expects to wait at least another 30 years if not for ever He was healthily sceptical of all the usual optimistic arguments about the wonderful outcomes that never materialise I remember that it was argued that the introduction of the euro would add 3 per cent to GNP but GNP shrank My hon Friend pointed out that enlargement means that objective 1 and 2 grants to the UK are likely to come to an end That is the Irish point that enlargement may be morally right but we must be clear about what effects it must have that are in our interests He also seemed to be saying that the EU had attempted to buy his support by making not one but five grants to his constituency but I feel that there is little prospect of that attempt being successful

I cannot accept that There is a tension in the Chancellor s mind It is like good and evil sitting on either shoulder One side is telling him to run a budget surplus because that is an easy road to take That is not badly thought out Given the number of rules that Chancellors have thought up over the years and then failed to implement running a budget surplus is an extremely simple rule It is just too crude however That argument vies with the supply side strategy Following on from the question from the hon Member for Wycombe Mr Baker another friend from the Treasury Select Committee let us look at what the Office for Budget Responsibility says in its report about how the Budget supply side measures will work It states We also expect smaller positive contributions to potential output growth over the next five years from population growth while average hours worked are expected to trend down over time With a decrease in average hours in input and in population growth where is the productivity increase going to come from I should like to hear the answer from the Chancellor

Two women a week are killed by violent partners Thirty men a year are killed by their battered partners Many of the men and women charged with those killings put up the defence of provocation If the jury accepts it they will be convicted only of manslaughter and not of murder In those circumstances the punishment is not a mandatory life sentence but is at the judge s discretion The Government are undecided about whether to change the law on provocation imminently I shall set out what happens under the current law In domestic killings men kill because of anger and sexual jealousy Women kill because of abuse I have defended many women over the past decade who have killed their partners and I have never come across one who has killed from sexual jealousy or anger The women whom I have defended have killed only after being beaten and abused sometimes for years In the defence of provocation the defendant says that the killing was done during a sudden and temporary loss of self control caused by things said or done by the victim and in circumstances in which a reasonable person might have reacted as the defendant did The point of the defence is that although the defendant has killed his blameworthiness for overreacting is mitigated by the provocation from the victim Originally the defence required the provocative conduct to be wrong The philosophy behind provocation that its presence reduces the blameworthiness of killing would not make sense if a victim did only what she had a right to do or if she was not wrong to do it As long ago as the 19th century judges thought it a misuse of the defence of provocation to say that a man was provoked to kill when his wife left him They had a power to withdraw the defence from the jury s consideration when it was levelled against rightful acts or acts that were not wrong In such circumstances the judges did withdraw the defence Of course a woman has a right to leave a man if she does not want to live with him He can divorce her but he cannot kill her unless he wants to be convicted of murder However in this century the requirement that the provocation must be wrong in some way has disappeared One man was acquitted of murder when he claimed that he had been provoked to kill by a baby crying In recent years there have been cases in which women have been killed and men have said that they were provoked to lose their self control by nagging For one man the final provocation was the way that the woman moved the mustard pot across the table In a case in Leeds the defence of provocation was successful in a case in which a man had killed his wife not because she had left him but because she had told him that she was thinking of leaving him and going to live with her gym trainer We must remember that there are two parts to the defence of provocation It does not work unless in addition to showing provocative conduct the defendant shows that a reasonable person might have reacted to that conduct as the defendant did Surely killing a partner for moving the mustard pot in a certain way and saying that she fancies her gym teacher is not the reaction of a reasonable person so how did it come about that these men were acquitted The culprit is the House of Lords In the case of Morgan James Smith in 2000 the Lords said that when considering whether a reasonable person might have reacted to the provocation as the defendant did all the characteristics of the defendant must be taken into account Clearly to be fair one must consider whether a reasonable person of the same age might have reacted in the same way as self control goes with maturity However in the Smith case it was stated that all the defendant s characteristics have to be taken into account including any that might lower his standards of self control below the ordinary For that reason a defendant s bad temper and alcoholism are his characteristics and must be taken into account when consideration is given to whether any reasonable person would have done as he did Therefore one is supposed to impute the fine characteristics of the reasonable person and then ask whether a reasonable person who is bad tempered and alcoholic might have behaved as the defendant did However if one imputes the defendant s characteristics to the reasonable person the reasonable person turns into the defendant Therefore the question of whether a reasonable person who has now become the defendant might have reacted as the defendant did is meaningless as there is no second requirement At present there is no need for conduct to be wrong to be called provocation trivial behaviour cannot be withdrawn from the jury by the judge and there is no second requirement at all Add it all together and the only question left for the jury in a provocation defence is whether he lost his self control because of something she did If so he has a defence That is hopeless It offers no protection or rational basis for jury decisions In addition what does it say to her children or parents if the state says that his blame is less and she bears responsibility for her own killing because she moved the mustard pot The typical killing by a battered woman is not from anger and does not fit the sudden and temporary loss of self control model of provocation Almost all such killings take place when she is under attack She flees into the kitchen he comes after her she seizes a knife she turns and she stabs him once There is no defence of killing out of fear or despair that accommodates battered women in the way that provocation and killing out of anger accommodates men However there is far more emotional and psychological stress to justify a finding of less blameworthiness if someone kills after long tolerance of harsh wrong treatment rather than suddenly in anger One might think that the run into the kitchen and the turn round under attack is self defence but it is excessive To be a defence self defence must be proportionate If a woman is attacked only with fist or boot and even if the man is stronger and has used violence before if she takes a weapon lashes out and kills him the jury will not acquit her on self defence It is excessive It is disproportionate Excessive or disproportionate self defence leads to a conviction for murder not for manslaughter If I overreact to provocation as a man may do it is manslaughter If I overreact to being attacked as a woman may do it is murder Women in court are now defended on two bases First the defence tries arguing that the act was proportionate self defence Secondly if that fails she falls back on the claim that the attack provoked her into a sudden and temporary loss of self control that would have caused a reasonable person to do as she did and kill But proportionality in the first defence of self defence requires measurement and deliberation The defence of provocation requires a sudden and temporary loss of self control and a lashing out an overreaction It requires that a person has acted disproportionately The two defences are inconsistent Women do not fit the hot tempered provocation model into which one tries to squeeze them The jury can see perfectly well that the woman is outside provocation and that she has not killed from anger at a wrong but in terror and despair at yet another beating So both defences usually fail and thus do violent men who lose their self control get away with murder and battered women get convicted of it That is unjust It is also sexist The Government will introduce a duty on public authorities to promote gender equality but the courts which have to implement the current law on provocation and manslaughter will not be able to comply The Government know well that the need to reform the law is urgent and they have asked the Law Commission to consider the issue and make proposals The Law Commission has done so I am told by Mr Justice Toulson that the proposals are unlikely to change and have been well received with few exceptions by the judiciary and by academics I can say that the Fawcett Society Justice for Women Rights of Women Southall Black Sisters Women s Aid and all the women s lobby groups who deal with the issue are 100 per cent behind the proposals The purpose in asking the Law Commission to look at provocation was to consider legislation so the terms of reference asked for special attention to domestic violence However the Law Commission has worked out a defence for all manslaughter to an outstanding level which goes much wider than the terms of reference The calibre of the proposals is very good Under them unlawful homicide that would otherwise be murder would be manslaughter if the defendant acted in response to various factors Change No 1 is gross provocation meaning words or conduct or words and conduct that caused the defendant to have a justifiable sense of being seriously wronged That would restore the moral basis for provocation that the conduct in question must be wrongful The defendant would have to have legitimate grounds for feeling strongly aggrieved by the conduct of the person The question of whether that was justifiable would be for the jury not for the defendant Gross provocation ups the level of conduct needed to arouse a justifiable sense of grievance Anything less than gross anything less than wrongful and the court will be able to withdraw the defence from the jury because change No 2 is that the judge will not be required to leave the defence to the jury unless there is evidence on which a reasonable jury properly directed could conclude that it might apply Under change No 3 homicide that would otherwise be murder would be manslaughter instead if the act was carried out from fear of serious violence so the woman under attack in the kitchen would not have to pretend that she acted out of loss of self control she will be protected if she acted from fear of serious violence Of course before the jury looks at that partial defence it will have to look at self defence where that has been raised but if it finds that the defence was disproportionate it will ask whether it was too much because the woman was afraid It is a measure of how fair and realistic the report is and of how commendable it is that the Royal College of Psychiatrists gave evidence to the Law Commission challenging the assumption that anger the male emotion cannot be a justification for responsive violence while fear the female emotion can be The RCP pointed out that the two emotions of anger and fear are not distinct and that physiologically anger and fear are identical Many mental states that accompany killing also incorporate psychologically both anger and fear Hence the abused woman who kills in response even to an immediate severe threat will be driven at least partly by anger at the years of abuse meted out to her and perhaps to her children Change No 4 homicide that would otherwise be murder can be reduced to manslaughter by a combination of gross provocation causing a justifiable sense of wrong and fear Morally of course the common element is that it is a response to bad conduct The person would not kill at all had they not been attacked Even if there is gross provocation engendering a justifiable sense of wrong it by no means follows that an ordinary person would have reacted in the way that the defendant did Most people suffer gross provocation from time to time but they do not kill The final change is that the defence would be available only if a person of ordinary self control in the circumstances of the defendant might have reacted in the same or a similar way That would still take into account all the defendant s characteristics such as age but not matters that bear simply on his capacity for self control so no more bad temper no more alcohol A man or a woman seriously wronged justifiably feeling that they have been seriously wronged and exercising ordinary self control but who kills will have that defence Women killing under serious fear of violence will also have that defence All will become far more equal The case for change is overwhelming The Law Commission s proposals are rational clear just not sexist and fair They can be put into the Domestic Violence Crime and Victims Bill through an amendment that has already been tabled so this is my sole question to my hon Friend the Minister why not

I am clear that we need an immigration policy that is right for the whole of the United Kingdom and that takes into account the very specific needs that we have identified in Scotland However we know that the Scottish Government have powers that have very significant effects on immigration such as the powers on the level of tax and that making Scotland the highest taxed part of the UK is not a way to encourage people to come to Scotland

I respect the hon Gentleman s view but I disagree for reasons that I shall outline Even in the war pension scheme those latter questions are decided on a balance of probabilities standard of proof The effect would be to increase significantly the probability of acceptance of claims for compensation that had nothing to do with service in the armed forces and where it was even unlikely that there was a disablement or that the claimant had been a member of the armed forces The House is aware that the war pensions scheme burden and standard of proof are quite explicit in allowing claims to succeed even when it can be shown that the death or injury was unlikely to have been due to service I do not consider it reasonable to allow such arrangements to persist still less do I regard it as reasonable to extend their scope Inserting into the new compensation scheme a burden and standard of proof more generous than we have announced would be expensive Our latest assessment is that the total cost would run to more than 300 million after 10 years with a continuing annual premium There has been a mistaken suggestion that that sum was a saving and that the value of the scheme would be reduced as a result of the change to the burden and standard of proof That is not the case There has been no such saving were we to accept the amendment substantial additional money would be required over and above our broadly cost neutral proposals This is because we have taken the savings from the changed burden and standard of proof and used them to provide bigger payments where the need can be expected to be greatest The most obvious example of that is the award for the first time of major cash lump sums to a maximum of 280 000 for pain and suffering caused to the more seriously injured That key group is frankly poorly served by the current scheme In short the current war pensions scheme arrangements allow a claim to succeed when there is no evidence that a condition is linked to service That means that our funds are not focused properly on those whose disablements are greatest and whose conditions are likely to have been caused by service In effect by changing the design of our compensation arrangements as we have we have taken away from a minority of cases for whom death or injury is unlikely to have been caused by service and given to those who are more seriously disabled We cannot afford to do both and I have no doubt that our decision is the right one Looking at the new compensation scheme as a whole I am confident that it will deliver fair and reasonable outcomes The new arrangements invite both claimant and the Ministry of Defence to provide evidence relating to a claim Both sets of evidence would be subject to the same careful scrutiny and would be given equal weight in the process of evaluation Only if the evidence were equally balanced or if there were an absence of clear evidence one way or the other would the burden of proof result in a rejection of the claim The proposals are in line with those for civil courts and follow a pattern widely used in other schemes I hope that the House will recognise that the arrangements are in fact the same as those used to determine the outcome of claims for attributable benefits under the current armed forces pension scheme It is worth knowing that it is generally the current armed forces pension not the war pension that provides the larger share of the benefits paid in a case of invaliding or death due to service However the Government have not ignored the concerns expressed since the Bill moved to the Lords in July We have looked carefully at the Royal British Legion s concerns that our proposals do not represent a fair balance of responsibilities between the claimant and the Department Our approach does not place the whole of the evidential burden on the claimant The scheme rules will provide that the Secretary of State or at appeal the pensions appeal tribunal will decide whether on the basis of all the relevant evidence before them it is more likely than not that the injury illness or death is due to service That evidence will include any supporting evidence provided by the claimant It will also include the claimant s service and medical records and any additional evidence obtained by the Secretary of State We recognise that it would be unreasonable to ask the claimant to obtain evidence relating to his claim that is held in his official service records The scheme rules will impose a duty on the Secretary of State to make available to the claimant such evidence on request Any decision taken by the Secretary of State will be subject to appeal to the pensions appeal tribunal which in turn will have regard to the entire body of evidence whether provided by the claimant or the Secretary of State That will place a responsibility on the Secretary of State to provide a credible response to any substantial evidence submitted by the claimant I regret that the Royal British Legion has not been reassured despite the many conversations with it but I also accept that it has been flexible in recent months in offering alternative formulations of burden and standard of proof the point made by the hon Gentleman However flexibility has not been one way We have made a number of changes to our proposals already to address the concerns of the Royal British Legion and I shall give just three examples There will be an extended time limit for claims of five years instead of the three originally proposed provision for exceptional review where deterioration of someone s condition is substantially greater than would normally be expected and agreement to report to Parliament annually on the operation of the schemes I shall take a close personal interest in the working of the schemes and I can assure the House that if the system is found not to be delivering fair results the design of the arrangements will be reviewed I must however tell the House that there is no easy option here for Members who support the amendment They cannot cherry pick the parts of the current arrangements to which they remain deeply attached and at the same time embrace the improvements in the new compensation scheme I will not allow the new schemes to proceed on that basis If it comes to it I would prefer to withdraw the Bill entirely which would mean that that the benefits of the new pension and compensation schemes which are keenly sought by many people in the Armed Forces and the ex service community will be lost I hope that the Commons will tell the Lords that they have got it wrong and reject Lords amendment No 1

With respect that is exactly what I want to do I am just saying that if the Secretary of State was going to make a concession as major as the one that he has just made why did he not tell me at our meeting at 9 o clock last night The Secretary of State mentioned an additional 600 million to 1 billion in lottery income under the new Camelot licence Those numbers are based on items in the Camelot bid document He will know that they are very speculative They depend on the Treasury s agreeing to move to a gross profits tax which he said has not been confirmed he is simply prepared to consider it again They depend on the introduction of restrictions on lottery style games in adult gaming centres Again he said that he would ask the Gambling Commission and the National Lottery Commission to consider it but there is no undertaking that it will happen They also depend on the approval of the National Lottery Commission We have a commitment from the Secretary of State to examine ways to increase the returns to good causes versus what is written in black and white in the statutory instrument which is that there is to be a raid of 90 million on the arts and heritage budget and of 70 million on the grass roots sports budget

My hon Friend highlights how difficult it is for us in the brief time available to try to analyse in detail the casino advisory panel s report He and I should not be comparing the respective bids of our constituencies that should have been done in the context of a Committee set up for that purpose which could have taken evidence and questioned Professor Crow about his assertions The report was full of assertions with language such as I believe that or We feel that On an issue as important as this I want more than that We need an assessment of evidence and as firm a conclusion as possible We did not have that in the report I disagreed with Professor Crow s conclusions but he could have had better advice The Merits Committee pointed out that he addressed the issue of profitability which did not fall within his remit although the Committee accepted that it was a matter of common sense for him to consider it In Professor Crow s assessment of Blackpool he says that the regeneration benefits of the proposal before us are unproven But that is true of all the bidders for the super casino because we have never seen one No locality could prove its claims but why did he say that about Blackpool From my recollection he did not say it of any of the others He appears to have marked down Blackpool on all his subheadings including methodology and location The most condescending and indeed hurtful remark in Professor Crow s report however was about the economy of Blackpool He said that he did not accept that our economy was declining in spite of the overwhelming evidence given to him by the very large numbers of people who appeared in the public evidence session He said that he believed that there would be stabilisation at a lower level He went on to say that this may well include the management of contraction If so this situation should be resolutely faced by the authorities and local businesses alike without visions of external intervention to cure all ills How dare he say that What we were bidding for was absolutely the most appropriate external intervention in Blackpool We have an economy that is built on leisure and tourism Where else should there be a super casino but by the seaside in Blackpool Yet Professor Crow says that we should not look for external intervention but that Manchester was already regenerated

I would like to press the Health Secretary further on the unsustainable providers regime which has been enacted in the South London Healthcare NHS Trust Given that the statutory guidance for that regime explicitly states that it is not to be used as a back door route to service reconfiguration why are Lewisham A and E and maternity services earmarked for closure If that is not a service reconfiguration can he tell me what is

The Labour Opposition day motion which the Secretary of State supported yesterday calls on the Government to investigate mis selling and ensure consumers are compensated He seems to believe that that can apply only to future mis selling but examples such as payment protection insurance and lawyers charging additional fees to coal health claimants prove that that is not the case Will he back our demand for an urgent inquiry into mis selling with redress for those who have already suffered

My hon Friend makes a very good point I have had an extremely good paper from St Mungo s dealing with that very issue We also need to do more listening We must stop talking over people who suffer with psychosis or schizophrenia They are warm live human beings They exist We tend too often to talk over them and about them not to them Certainly there will be times when they are in crisis but when they are we need a crisis plan so that they can tell us how they want to be treated looked after and cared for how we can help to secure their dignity Then we need to ensure that they have advocates who can sit alongside them and be their voice someone they trust at a time of crisis illness and distress We need more support for carers the people who love them the people who stand by them day in and day out trying to do the right thing trying to get them the care that they deserve and require their champions Let us not forget in this place the important role that carers play in being the champions We need much more talking and listening to carers involving them in the process They will know so much more about the individual being cared for than probably anyone else Then we need to provide more training for people working in the mental health arena It is a demanding environment In the acute settings people tend to be admitted who are very ill The threshold for admittance is so much higher now The staff need to be trained to deal with and to care for these people It is no reflection on the staff that I am asking for this I want to stand shoulder to shoulder with the staff We want to stand alongside them and help them to deliver the care that they want to deliver and that their professional pride demands that they deliver

I was just about to make that point We have built on the work that had already been undertaken but we would not have done so but for the fact that the Government Whips ignored let us be honest about it all the signs that the House had already given that hon Members were no longer prepared to put up with the incestuous way in which Select Committees were appointed The point that I want to make is that if it had not been for last summer s incident the Liaison Committee s work frankly would have gone by the board It has already been said that attempts have been made under previous Governments to nobble Select Committees to ensure that trouble makers were kept off and trustees were put on but it would be fair to say that the Conservative party has tended to be more disciplined or perhaps more devious than the Labour party was last summer Whichever it was the fact of the matter is that all this has now come out into the open I now make my confession I served on the Committee of Selection for four years I was ex officio a member of that Committee and I can tell the House if I am breaking some dreadful convention I shall no doubt be locked up in the Tower that most of our meetings took less three minutes On one occasion when I was in the Chair as the senior member a meeting took half a minute That is not a proper way to take important decisions The right hon Member for East Yorkshire referred to a previous regime in that Committee when he said that some of the Whips nominations were turned down I think that he will agree that they were not nominations to Select Committees they were nominations to Standing Committees There is all the difference in the world between serving on a Select Committee and having that responsibility for scrutinising the Government perhaps for a whole Parliament and serving on a Committee that considers a specific Bill So the House should be fully aware that I know of no one outside the usual channels who wants to return to that regime We must be very careful this evening that we do not untangle the whole package by pulling it to bits If we do that the only winners will be the two main Whips Offices I have to exclude my hon Friend the Member for Hazel Grove Mr Stunell he is not here at the moment because my party has been excluded from those discussions all too often in the past The consensus is that we have to make some improvements but let us recognise the fact that the improvements will be experimental by their very nature Everything that we do in the House is evolutionary we can return to the issue if the proposals do not work sufficiently well but we must make progress tonight otherwise we shall be in real difficulty I have no great problem with the proposals for the new Committee of Nomination except to say that the amendments are excessively complicated We may well have to consider the issue after the next election If the two Opposition parties whichever of the current three they may be were extremely similar in size perhaps differing by one or two Members the arithmetic clearly would not work nor would it work if let us suppose that this could happen women made up 60 per cent of the House after the next general election as these gender balance arrangements would be obviously nonsensical Let us be clear the proposal is for this Parliament but we must establish the principle that the House makes the decision rather than having it made for it by Government Whips in collusion with the main Opposition party Whips I must say to the Chairman of the Liaison Committee in all sincerity that I am somewhat suspicious of the way in which the Committee approached the issue of numbers It represents the establishment the insiders the people who have got there As the hon Member for Stafford Mr Kidney said we are in danger of wasting good talent in the House if we automatically assume that just because it is easier to manage 11 people it is not possible for 15 to do an even better job

Thank you Mr Deputy Speaker for instinctively knowing that I wanted to be called after the hon Member for Brigg and Goole Andrew Percy who talks an awful lot of sense particularly about the English baccalaureate Today is an opportunity for us to discuss the principle of the Bill which is why it is so disappointing that the first 52 minutes of the debate were about politics A number of elephant traps were set to try to make the Labour party look as though it were the roadblock to reform which is not the case The Bill raises important issues It includes a shift from Whitehall to the classroom but it also goes in other directions It goes from local people in the form of local authorities to individual schools Parts 5 and 6 in particular relate to local authorities and schools admissions and they will remove the admissions role of schools adjudicators increase the emphasis on academies and remove the requirement to consult on them Also relevant are free schools appropriate consultation and the disappearance of local admissions forums All those issues point to a broad but consistent agenda that seeks to undermine the role of local authorities and each of us in our individual locations We are losing the sense that we are together making decisions in our towns and cities about how we educate our young people There are trade offs involved and we should not seek to minimise them This is our role in debating the principles behind the Bill There has been a lot of talk on both sides about the number of young people coming from a free school meals background and going to Cambridge I came from a free school meals background and went to Cambridge so I would have been included in the figures Much as I am concerned about that issue I am more concerned about the young people in my constituency who come from a free school meals background or just above that line and who are not achieving the results that they should I went to a comprehensive school in Luton and when I left school in 1998 which is not so long ago only one third of young people in my constituency were achieving five GCSEs at grades A to C the kind of thing that would help them to get on in life At the time of the last election the figure was two thirds so real progress was made under Labour I concede that much of that progress was made as a result of the arguments about whether we should have more choice and more autonomy in schools We have two excellent academies in Luton one of which started in my constituency and will shortly move into a new building I do not want to undermine the ability of people to come in and turn around schools that are really struggling but we should not pretend there is no trade off in relation to the power of individual heads versus power being pooled or to the sense that together we are educating our young people The situation in Luton illustrates those points very well We had 11 Building Schools for the Future projects cancelled in the BSF cancellations For us the projects were not just about providing world class facilities but about providing the additional capacity that we desperately need We have a major issue with our primary schools we have projected that we will need another 5 000 places at a cost of 76 million but we will get only 4 million over the next four years As a result of more providers coming in there is a disjointed admissions policy and successful free schools and academies will serve only to increase the gap My concern is that we are squeezing provision and narrowing the options in places such as Luton about how to respond to the diverse challenges required in education The choice is between academies and free schools or nothing There is not even a chance to expand good quality comprehensive education because no additional is money coming in and there is no scope for local people to step in through the realms of the local authority and choose what type of school is appropriate for them Last weekend the English Defence League was in Luton and it raised the issue once again of community cohesion in our town Education is about more than children achieving what they can in terms of grades and results It is also about the kind of society that we want to create If we want a comprehensive and mixed society in which people from different backgrounds come together surely in a place such as Luton comprehensive education is the ideal We have schools that are doing the work and want to expand so why close them off and tell them that the only route is through free school education Schools are drilling down into more reduced catchment areas and the only route to expanding capacity is through academies or free schools The slimmed down admissions codes that are coming might make the situation even worse In his speech the Secretary of State cast himself as a brave reformer and cast Labour Members as the luddites who refuse to adapt to a changing world but that is not the case I believe there is a move which started under the previous Government and continues under this one to put more power into the hands of individual head teachers and away from local authorities which are tasked with the responsibility of together finding a response that is appropriate to their setting We have to accept that doing that comes with a cost If the very principle of the Bill is to suck power away from the pooling of heads we will have a model for education that is prescribed controlled and modelled In Luton the effect of the Bill will be to store up problems for the future and for that reason for my constituents I will not vote for it tonight

First I congratulate my hon Friend the Financial Secretary on achieving so much in two months He said that he had done more in two months than Labour did in two years but he underestimates it He has done more in two months than they did in 10 years Nevertheless there is a great deal left to be done as my hon Friend himself said Halfway through next year is still a long time to wait for many of the more elderly policyholders Can he give the House an undertaking that he will stick to that timetable so that those policyholders receive their compensation before they die in many cases He said that he was still considering Sir John Chadwick s proposals Will he ensure that not only he but the independent commission takes representations from EMAG and do so quickly

I have declared my interests in the register The Secretary of State finds himself in a dreadful situation I echo the comments of my right hon and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe Mr Clarke and my right hon Friend the Member for North West Cambridgeshire Sir B Mawhinney who spoke with considerable experience about how much more costly it is now going to be to sort out the problems of our railway industry how much delay there will be in sorting them out and how much confidence this Secretary of State on behalf of this Government has knocked out of the relationship between the Government and financiers bank managers bond financiers and those who raise equity money It is right for people to ask what the Opposition would do I am very happy to suggest what could be done in this situation as it is clearly well beyond the skills and attention of the Secretary of State The legal position as I understand it is that the shareholders of Railtrack at group level retain residual assets They must make their own decisions on whether they wish to continue trading those assets in some form or sell them and rescue what little money they can from the group assets that are not in administration They also have a clear interest in the administrator obtaining best value if he can secure value for the assets in administration That is also the legal duty with which the administrator is charged The Secretary of State is not in control of that process nor should he be Those are assets that have been placed into administrative receivership and now have to be sorted out as best they can by the administrator The sooner that they are sold on to an owner who can do something with them and set about rebuilding the battered balance sheet the better it will be The Secretary of State is in danger I think of misleading his own Back Benchers He implies that his model of the not for profit company is the one that will naturally emerge from the administration process That is by no means clear Labour Back Benchers may be disappointed to discover that bids are received and they may be even more disappointed if one or other of them is better than any bid that can be put forward by the not for profit company We still do not know who will sponsor the not for profit company how it will write a prospectus how it will raise cash who will serve on it and what type of guarantees it or other bidders will receive from the Government I hope that the Government are in no doubt that they will have to offer fair funding to any bidders They should of course first apologise for the mess that they have created but the only sensible course that they can then follow is to state clearly to Parliament and the public for the first time what money is available to those who will be charged with the duty of running the Railtrack assets Bidders will then be able to bid on the basis of greater certainty and to ascribe a negative or positive value to the assets that are in administration I fear that in their current shape the assets have a negative value and that a substantial dowry will be required by whoever takes them on It is obvious that Railtrack s balance sheet must be strengthened In answer to one of my questions the Secretary of State said that he hoped that the new company would have an A credit rating There is no way that Railtrack on paper could command such a rating in its current guise I would expect the balance sheet to require a sum well above 1 billion of additional equity or surrogate equity which I think is the Secretary of State s preferred route He cannot quite bring himself to admit that he must inject new extra capital into a company whose shareholders he has just helped to bankrupt but he will have to put in that equity or surrogate equity of well over 1 billion to give it any chance of securing some kind of credit rating in the City The Secretary of State seemed to know that on 3 July when in rejecting the idea of the not for profit public interest company that had been suggested by some Members he told the House that it would cost 2 billion to buy out the shareholders we know that he does not wish to do that now and another 4 billion to sort out the bond holders because there is that amount of bond finance in Railtrack When I asked him today in the House whether he proposed to wipe out the bond holders or whether he was effectively offering a Government guarantee for the 4 billion he characteristically declined to answer but the question is terribly important to assessing the cost to the Secretary of State of the forced administration of the Railtrack enterprise Then there are the costs of the administration itself which are likely to be high Given the phenomenal legal bills that the Secretary of State and his advisers must be incurring and those incurred by those advising the administrator Railtrack and the regulator many of which will be a charge on public funds I suggest that there will be no change out of 100 million for the fees of lawyers accountants and others involved in reporting on the progress of Railtrack and the amount could escalate well beyond that I should be delighted if the Minister intervened to assure me that the Government have received quotes for all those charges well in advance and the amount will be smaller but I think that it would be safe to pencil in well over 100 million something similar to the huge fees that the Government are running up in the public private partnership negotiations in regard to London Underground which remain stalled and mired in difficulty and uncertainty There is also the cost control that the company itself was minded to implement but that is probably not currently being implemented by the administrator I estimate that at least 250 million of costs would have been saved in the trading year ending next March and will probably not materialise because a degree of management has been removed from the company and the administrator is taking things more easily in an attempt to find out what is there and how he can proceed We then come to the 800 million that has already been guaranteed by the Government That was squirrelled out by a question asked by someone else I was not told although I asked a direct question that should have required that answer Anyway we know that 800 million has already been guaranteed or has gone to deal with the day to day bills of the company in administration and given the cash forecasts that we have heard from the Secretary of State presented by the company before he made his decision there may be another 650 million to go out before the end of the year I am sure that the Government will feel that they must guarantee that in some way If we leave aside the 4 billion of bond holders money there are different ways of treating it but according to the Secretary of State it should all be a direct charge on public accounts we arrive at a total of 2 8 billion by the end of the year to try to keep the company going and start sorting out the problems in administration I suggest that that is well in excess of anything that the Government needed to give or would have granted to the company before it was put into receivership I have asked the Secretary of State to tell the House how much would have gone into the company this year and next if plans had continued under the 2 April agreement but I have received no answer I think that Ministers should tell us how much they had planned to put in both directly and through the Strategic Rail Authority what the timing of the payments would have been and what extra amount they estimated might be needed on top of that I find it extraordinary that Ministers could sign off on a going concern audit basis in the summer of this year and a few weeks later be scrambling around saying that the company would become insolvent and something drastic would have to be done My right hon and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe made a more general point about the cost of this Secretary of State to the Government Let us take just the transport element of private finance under the 10 year plan 35 billion perhaps 34 billion If we assume that the cost of the Secretary of State s damage amounts to only an extra 1 per cent per annum in interest to allow for the greater hazards involved in doing business with the Government now we are talking about an extra 3 5 billion over a typical 10 year term of debt That would be the extra cost of financing a programme of this size and that is just one element The Secretary of State will have to stand accused of increasing the costs of financing a number of Government programmes The Government anticipated large sums of private money for other transport systems health educational establishments prisons and a wide range of other public facilities There is no doubt given the City s current mood that the price has just gone up Some very smooth talking and the removal of the Secretary of State will be required to reassure people and put the price down again I am glad that the Government think that a matter for so much hilarity but the public are not amused This has meant a delay in vital investment in the railway industry It has interrupted the progress of an industry that the Government themselves said was going rather better as a result of privatisation Before the general election in May in Westminster Hall the hon Member for Streatham Keith Hill then a transport Minister made a very good speech praising the growth in traffic the improvement in investment and the new equipment that was coming to the railways success that he believed had been achieved by the industry in privatised ownership since 1997 I found myself in full agreement with him I did not confess that at the time because I knew that he had said those things because an election was coming up and he wanted to claim some credit for a Tory success a few years earlier But I see that he is enjoying the situation now because he knows that what he said was true and that those who have taken over have made an awful mess A new Secretary of State came in and overruled the perfectly sensible policy espoused by the hon Gentleman and his then colleagues causing the trouble that we are now seeing Time does not permit me to say much more Let me end by saying that this Secretary of State is going to send a huge bill to the travelling public the taxpayer and the Government as a whole It is a disgrace and he should go We need someone who understands how the market works and how to raise the colossal sums that we need to get the railways on the move

No it s not rubbish it s factual My message to the Government and the message of those in my area who have been on heroin is to let the doctors make the medical decisions not the politicians Let those who have been on methadone in my area stay on methadone so that they are stable out of crime back at work and are not dragged in with their families and called drug addicts again which is what is happening in my area with Crime Reduction Initiatives this so called charity I say the same thing when it comes to psychoactive substances let the doctors determine the treatment not the politicians On this the Government have got it wrong Through his brilliant and superb Parliamentary Private Secretary I invite the Minister with responsibility for drugs to meet some of the people in my constituency in the near future

My hon Friend is right I refer him to clause 2 5 f which specifically covers the training of staff who provide relevant services to adults with such conditions in the guidance that the Secretary of State issues That provision is included for the reasons that my hon Friend outlined I pay great tribute to the Minister of State Department of Health the hon Member for Corby Phil Hope He is not with us today because he has a vital duty to perform in his constituency so I am delighted that the Under Secretary of State for Health the hon Member for Brentford and Isleworth Ann Keen is here I am sure that she will do an excellent job today The Minister of State did not start off entirely supporting the Bill but my goodness he has got behind it He has done a first class job in his current ministerial position which I am glad he continues to hold because I hope that he will supervise the legislation if we are fortunate enough to get it through the House today and through the other place in due course The Bill has the potential to deliver the crucial improvements needed for the approximately 500 000 people with autism in the UK who have been neglected for so long It is the culmination of a great deal of work by many people The effort that has gone into the Bill is a testament not only to the determination and dedication of many of my colleagues in the House on a cross party basis but to a large number of people outside I have paid tribute to those people in previous speeches so perhaps they will forgive me if I do not name them today but the National Autistic Society and all the other charities that have been involved have done a first class job on behalf of the group that they represent I would like also to thank the Members who supported the Bill and those who served on the Public Bill Committee which shows what we can achieve when we work together Lastly before I get to the substance of the Bill I would like again to thank my hon Friend the Member for Tiverton and Honiton who has been a champion on the issue The Bill builds on her earlier ten minute Bill and to sound just a small sour note resulted also from the Government s failure to respond or to fulfil their promises on autism in the past To be truthful the Bill is really her Bill which because I won a lottery I have been fortunate enough to present Autism was long overdue serious consideration as outcomes for both children and adults were consistently so much poorer than those for people who do not have autism A recent report by the NAS found that 40 per cent of children with autism had been bullied that 27 per cent had been excluded from school and that 42 per cent reported that they had no friends In addition 70 per cent had a psychiatric condition accompanying their autism For adults the picture is even bleaker The NAS estimates that 63 per cent of adults with autism do not receive enough support while 82 per cent of parents or carers of adults with autism say that their child needs daily support just to live independently Only 15 per cent of adults with autism are in full time work and 75 per cent do not have any friends or find it very hard to make friends while 40 per cent of adults with autism still live with their parents We currently fail both children and adults with autism in this country

My question is not intended to be pejorative because I am genuinely interested in the answer Does the Home Secretary accept that there is a sea of difference between SIAC being used to deal with issues of deportation with all the problems that SIAC has as a review body and its being used to review decisions to incarcerate and imprison indefinitely without trial and indeed without charge If evidence exists against the people about whom we have heard why are they not being charged and tried in this country

They will reveal that the options were examined and did not take the form of a final recommendation because we had had discussions that led to a conclusion In the case of a final salary pension scheme the bill for the Chancellor s policy is met by the employer In the case of a defined contribution scheme it is met by the individual s pension pot and ultimately out of the pension paid to the individual employee It is therefore completely absurd for Ministers to claim as they do that the changes have helped employers who have ended up paying the additional costs into their pension funds or individual pensioners who are members of defined contribution schemes who will end up receiving reduced pensions as a result of the increased burden on their pension fund That is why it is correct to say that the primary effect of the changes has been to contribute in a significant way to the reduction in the availability of final salary schemes outside the public sector by roughly two thirds since this Government came to office It is significant that in the Chancellor s responses to interventions all the statistics that he quoted in relation to the availability of final salary schemes ran out in 2000 or 2001 We are now in 2007 and anybody who has been engaged in private sector activity over the past decade must surely understand that private sector pension provision on a final salary basis has been in sharp retreat throughout that period and in particular in recent years To an important extent that is a result of the policies that the Government have pursued It is also true that the primary effect of the changes has been to reduce pensions paid out by defined contribution schemes My final comments focus on the secondary effects of the changes Increased tax burdens have resulted in reduced availability of final salary schemes and in less generous payments by defined contribution schemes However there have been two important secondary effects and it is important that the Government not only accept responsibility for them but are seen to do so in public debate The first secondary effect is that if additional costs to providing final salary schemes are imposed on employers it has the effect of tipping some employers marginal employers into administration and receivership It is those employers whose employees have been among the primary victims of the changes Constituents of mine who were employed by the British United Shoe Machinery Company and who saw their savings evaporated rightly hold the Chancellor not exclusively responsible the hon Member for Twickenham Dr Cable was right to say that there were other important contributors but responsible for public policy The Chancellor took a position that was poor for those people at the margin and then made it worse Their pension savings evaporated and they rightly hold him responsible for that effect The other secondary effect is much more broadly based across the economy and in the long run particularly if we can agree to lifeboat proposals for the people who have been badly damaged by companies that have gone into administration much more concerning for the social structure of this country If we take a pension world that is moving more and more towards defined contributions schemes and where those schemes are as a result of this tax policy becoming less generous in terms of the pensions that they pay out and combine that with the tax credit policies that the Chancellor has also been pursuing and therefore the increased reliance of pensioners on means tested benefits we can see that we have hugely undermined the incentives on people to provide for their old age The end result of his policy has been reduced individual responsibility because as my right hon Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden rightly said pensions advisers are entirely rationally telling people who are on relatively modest incomes that against the background of the high level of means tested benefits and relatively low levels of pay out from defined contribution schemes they do not have much interest in saving for their old age through a pension fund We have seen the result of the Government s policy at the margin reducing to an important extent the incentive on the citizen to accept their individual responsibility for providing for their old age what the Chancellor in an earlier age might have referred to as prudence The effect of that has been the renationalisation of pension provision and a sharp move back towards seeing the state the taxpayer as the primary provider of income in old age rather than encouraging individual responsibility during our working lives The key objectives of policy going forward must be to reverse the drift back into state dependency to encourage independence and to encourage people to provide for their pension in their old age and to protect to a better degree than the Government have yet shown themselves willing to do my hon Friends on the Front Bench have demonstrated that we are willing to do this those whose interests have been sold down the river by the Brown mugging of the occupational pension scheme

I will indeed bear that in mind Madam Deputy Speaker and will speak briefly although I think that the issues that I wish to raise are fairly substantial While I agree with all who have congratulated the Members on both sides of the House who have brought us to this point I think that there is still a lack of action on key issues and that the Bill as it stands falls a long way short of providing justice for victims of slavery There are three core gaps in the Bill First we need to get the definitions right which is the aim of my new clause 24 If we do not do that we shall risk leaving open legal loopholes that will allow traffickers to thrive Secondly the Bill must deliver for victims which is the aim of new clause 21 Thirdly there are issues in relation to prevention which I hope to address later in the debate around new clause 1 The definition of human trafficking was established in an internationally binding treaty and was integrated into the national laws of some 134 countries That definition brings with it significant victim protection and a comprehensive framework for addressing trafficking which is why I propose that we return to that in new clause 24 Unlike the international definition of trafficking the trafficking provision in this Bill does not criminalise the harbouring or the reception or the exchange or transfer of control of victims or even the recruitment of victims where those acts do not involve the arrangement or facilitation of travel We should recognise that there is a real problem in cases involving large criminal networks where different people take different roles in the trafficking process There is also a problem where victims arrange their own travel into and around the UK and to the site of exploitation as often occurs when individuals are deceived about work conditions or conditions deteriorate over time The Bill s definition which is narrowly focused on the movement of victims adds nothing but confusion and will let traffickers off the hook for the crimes they commit as my hon Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull North Diana Johnson pointed out Let me turn briefly to the purpose of new clause 21 In its current form it is hard to see what this Bill would provide for the 40 Hungarian men found last year living in squalid conditions and forced to work for less than 2 a day in a mattress factory in Dewsbury west Yorkshire The men were barely surviving on limited food They were crammed into a two bedroom flat and threatened with violence if they resisted They were exploited by gangmasters who supplied their forced labour to a factory run by the bed manufacturer KozeeSleep which provides its products to some of our major national retailers Those victims of human trafficking have a right to compensation for the appalling wrongs that have been inflicted upon them Clauses 8 and 9 include provisions for reparation orders to be made in cases where the perpetrator is convicted and a confiscation order is made but from 2011 to 2013 only 252 trafficking and forced labour cases were prosecuted and just 78 of them less than a third resulted in convictions Not only are conviction rates low but compensation orders are rare The Government do not keep statistics on this but we know from victim support providers that they are few and far between I have tabled new clause 21 to allow victims themselves to bring civil claims in the county court to seek compensation directly from the trafficker not from the public purse in the many cases where a criminal prosecution has not been possible A similar provision is currently in use in the US Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act 2003 and is frequently used successfully to secure compensation for trafficking victims These steps are essential to get a Bill that makes a difference to the lives of victims We must get the very foundations of this Bill right by aligning our definitions with international law and where people are exploited making absolutely sure that they are compensated for the abuse suffered I recognise that we may not get that through agreement on these amendments today but I hope that these issues will be addressed when the Bill is debated in another place These measures together with real action on prevention can make the difference between a Bill that will deliver headlines and a Bill that will deliver justice

I am grateful for the opportunity to make a standing rather than sedentary intervention in the debate The First Minister will designate the Lord Advocate as the appropriate person to pursue these matters but he will be acting as a Minister and not as a Law Officer The hon Gentleman will know that Lords Advocate in the past have had to separate these two roles and have done so pretty well under different Administrations Also information obtained in relation to civil proceedings would not normally be disclosed in criminal actions I hope that those two points reassure the hon Gentleman

Thank you for calling me Mr Speaker for what I hope will be a brief intervention prompted by the remarks of my hon Friend the Member for Banbury Tony Baldry and the right hon Member for Wentworth and Dearne John Healey Later this evening the House will consider yet again many of us would say the Health and Social Care Bill but the issue for consideration now is whether the Government should publish the transitional risk register on the Bill The right hon Member for Wentworth and Dearne was explicit that he was not arguing that all strategic risk registers should be published and acknowledged the argument that there needed to be private space in which civil servants could give advice to Ministers secure in the knowledge that it would remain private because there was an important interest of good government that that discipline and space should exist That is an argument that he explicitly accepted and of which I am a strong supporter My hon Friend the Member for Banbury reminded the House that only yesterday two retired former heads of the civil service told peers in the other place of the importance of the principle that Ministers must be able to receive advice from civil servants on policy issues including the risks associated with them without that advice later becoming public The issue that the right hon Member for Wentworth and Dearne did not cover but which is important is that there needs to be confidence within the civil service about which side of the line advice will fall If civil servants can give advice to Ministers believing that it will remain confidential and if after the advice is given the line is moved and the advice falls to be published we run the risk that across Whitehall the space that he advocates will in truth not exist because there will not be the confidence that the advice will not later fall to be published

Does my hon Friend agree that there will not now be the automatic application of the Barnett formula to solve all the many money issues between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom but there has to be a fundamental renegotiation of the block grant and an attribution to Scotland of revenues by some formula In practice the whole financial settlement is in the melting pot anyway so it will be very interesting to see how the SNP respond to his proposed further development

I commend the Leader of the House for adding in a speech outside the House to the debate on party political funding and on the democratic deficit illustrated by very low election turnouts Does he agree that there needs to be a debate in the House on the matter quite soon That would enable those of us with doubts about parts of his policy to cross examine him about them I am referring to the fact that trade unions are excluded from funding restrictions yet the restrictions apply to political parties outside election times That policy seems to benefit the Government whichever party is power

Thank you for calling me to speak in this excellent debate Mr Deputy Speaker I commend my hon Friend the Member for Aldershot Sir Gerald Howarth for the powerful case he made for ensuring that we have an adequate defence budget for our country The Bill is vital I also commend my hon Friend for his lifelong dedication to supporting Her Majesty s armed forces and to the defence of Queen and country there is no greater champion of the defence of the realm than my hon Friend I hope that hon Members will agree with me that as my hon and gallant Friend the Member for Beckenham Bob Stewart has just said the first priority of Her Majesty s Government regardless of their political persuasion is the defence of the realm and the protection of British people from threat both internal and external Protecting Britons from harm defending our democratic way of life and upholding our freedom must surely be our first duty in this place That is why our membership of NATO has been so vital and must be protected To maintain a 2 minimum spending target is a wise allocation of public funds and a necessary investment in the defence of our nation We can ring fence other budgets but surely the defence of the realm should be uppermost in our priorities Securing our freedom is worth every 1 we spend In my view defence should certainly take precedence over our commitments on international aid The Bill will enable the Government of the day to carry out their solemn duties to this country in the confidence that those who wish to subvert our way of life will not succeed Some would argue that in the post cold war era such investment in our national defence is no longer necessary but if the actions of Vladimir Putin in Ukraine and Syria have taught us anything it is that we can no longer take for granted the notion that the cold war is well and truly behind us Our nation faces powerful enemies nations and terrorist organisations and cells just as we did in the 1980s They pose significant threats to our national interests and security Even if we accept the highly dubious argument that we live in a post cold war world we must conclude only that the new era makes continuing to invest adequately in our armed forces more imperative than ever

I wonder whether the Foreign Secretary has noted the statement issued by the new Iraqi governing council that savaged the Arab media for romanticising the deposed dictator Saddam Hussein It also attacked the BBC for not telling the truth about Iraq Does he share my concern that when faced with 300 000 missing people and mass graves and given that a vicious and murderous dictator has been removed and that freedom has been brought to a whole country for the first time in 20 years it is strange that the BBC and especially the Today programme is obsessed with only bad news stories about Iraq that damage the Government and the Prime Minister personally

I thank the hon Gentleman for that intervention He makes a good point There is a big problem with the transfer of credit Sometimes it can work in the consumer s interest if they can get a genuinely lower rate of interest and use the system However there are real dangers involved I am not suggesting that the new clause will be a panacea to resolve all the problems of irresponsible lending in the credit industry Further to the hon Gentleman s point the Treasury Committee noted that people often transfer their credit card balance having received a commitment of a nil rate of interest for perhaps a year However they are often not told that new purchases on the card will be charged at the full rate of interest or that when they pay off some of the balance it will be taken off the balance transfer not the new purchases They therefore find that they are paying interest when they did not expect to So there are many problems and they all come down to the practice of responsible lending We still have a way to go to get the industry fully to understand the importance of that concept I am seeking to address one specific historic problem which is that in the view of the industry and the Information Commissioner there cannot be a full sharing of data The commissioner has advised the industry that it would be a breach of the Data Protection Act 1998 to share data without consent Incidentally the problem has got much worse because as the hon Member for Rhondda Chris Bryant pointed out there has been a revolution involving people shopping around In the old days all our needs were met by one institution a bank or whatever Now people shop around for the best value product so the need to address the problem of data sharing has grown considerably The Information Commissioner has said that under the old agreements in which there is no provision for data sharing a lender would need the customer s consent to share such information The only solution available at the moment therefore is for the lender to go to the customer and ask for their consent Members will appreciate having sent out political mailings to people that the response rate to such requests would be tiny The industry reckons that it would be less than 1 per cent We cannot resolve the problem simply by seeking consent under the existing rules New clause 1 seeks to address that

My hon Friend s position is the same as mine I campaigned for remain but my constituency voted leave People are looking for a compromise that will work the problem with the Government s proposal is that it will not work and they know that I want to get something absolutely clear with the Chancellor For the millions who work in the financial services the deal and framework give no clarity on what any equivalence regime might look like It damages the country politically and most importantly economically We were initially told and the Chancellor has repeated this today that we would secure enhanced equivalence Paragraph 38 of the framework starts Noting that both Parties will have equivalence frameworks Will the Chancellor confirm that an enhanced equivalence deal has been signed already Enhanced agreement is what we were offered and promised by the Chancellor There is no reference to enhanced equivalence only to equivalence That means greater insecurity for the finance sector one of the key sectors of our economy

No I will not take any more interventions The right hon Gentleman and his hon Friends commissioned the Browne report knowing perfectly well that what would follow from it was a recommendation significantly to increase the cap level for universities That is what they were committed to and that is what they would have done We know because of the financial position of the country and the commitments made by the former Chancellor and by my predecessor that there would have been deep cuts in this Department resulting in a very substantial reduction in the support for universities the consequences of which were inevitable It is sheer dishonesty and opportunism It is dishonest and opportunistic for the right hon Gentleman and his colleagues to pretend that they would have done anything other than introduce recommendations to increase the graduate contribution but with one significant difference from what we have done because it never occurred to them that the graduate contribution should be made significantly more progressive That is what we have done and that is the proposition that I will be putting to the vote before Christmas

The answer is yes and my hon Friend s constituents understand that They know that the Conservative plans which were reported in The Guardian only on Monday for savage cuts that will go dramatically further than Labour s restrained policies will jeopardise all that investment in his constituency and all the investment that is going in and that has gone in to Wales in 13 years of Labour Government

I beg to move That this House has considered matters to be raised before the forthcoming adjournment It is always a privilege to lead such debates as Chair of the Backbench Business Committee not least at the moment as I am delighted to have the opportunity to talk about something other than our withdrawal from the European Union I promise not to utter the B word in the Chamber this afternoon Instead I will use the next few minutes to remind you Mr Deputy Speaker and colleagues on both sides of the House why I represent the best constituency in the United Kingdom with a few policy complaints thrown in I can say with absolute certainty that austerity is not over in Gateshead Despite the Government s proclamations to the contrary in recent months and despite their promise to shake the magic money tree for the north east of England we have seen more damaging cuts coupled with welfare reforms and chronic continually rising unemployment in my constituency I say that advisedly Unemployment in my constituency now stands at 7 2 and it has risen month on month every month without fail There are 470 more unemployed individuals that at the same time last year so unemployment has not gone away in the north east of England We see local authorities being forced to turn away vulnerable people from their doors In my constituency the employees of social housing providers are creating their own ad hoc unofficial food banks to help tenants who simply cannot make ends meet I am not sure whether we should be delighted that the UN rapporteur on extreme poverty Professor Philip Alston chose to visit Newcastle and Gateshead while gathering evidence Believe me we would much prefer not to be of interest to an investigation into extreme poverty None the less it was finally an opportunity for members of the communities I serve those communities are bearing the brunt of successive Government policies local authorities and voluntary organisations to share their experiences with officials from outside the region who care enough to listen The report published yesterday is a damning indictment of how this Government treat some of their citizens and of how they view their role in office Sadly nothing in Professor Philip Alston s report should come as a surprise to Members Opposition Members have repeatedly highlighted how this Government are driving constituents into abject poverty while slashing the support services that were once available to help the most vulnerable We have just had a great debate about Yemen It is ironic that Ministers are quite happy to accept UN evidence on Yemen but are openly dismissive of an objective UN report on what is happening here in terms of domestic policy That is rather strange This is and rightly should be a national embarrassment How many more of our constituents will be starved and frozen out of their homes before this Government decide to change course I believe that the existing council tax system contributes to the difficulties of local authorities like mine in Gateshead when it comes to raising enough money to meet increasing demand The system is flawed and requires urgent reform to establish some equality across the UK The vast majority of properties in my Gateshead constituency over 70 are in council tax bands A and B unlike in some parts of the south east where the average banding is C D or in some cases E Having a high proportion of band A and B properties significantly reduces how much money can be raised through the council tax system As a direct result Gateshead Council has no alternative but to continually raise council tax by the highest percentage allowed That in turn has resulted in Gateshead having one of the country s most expensive council tax bills for band A properties In Gateshead it costs nearly four times more in council tax to live in a one bedroom band A flat than it costs to live in a band D property here in Westminster which is clearly unfair The system is punitive outdated and regressive and it should be replaced at the earliest opportunity Withdrawing the revenue support grant without reforming and amending the council tax side of the local government funding system is causing hardship and suffering to our constituents and it must be considered almost criminal because of the way in which it impacts on individuals We have now had council tax for almost 30 years let us remember that it was meant to be a temporary stopgap after getting rid of the poll tax or the community charge as it was known and it does not work The band D national median is meaningless in a place like Gateshead Unilaterally taking away the revenue support grant without altering the other side of the system was a harsh decision that has clearly affected some areas much more than others I promised some positivity and I realise that my speech so far has set out a pretty bleak picture so let me say that despite revenue support grant cuts of more than 100 million per year my local authority continues to promote Gateshead as a great place to live work and invest Gateshead Council has already attracted hundreds of millions of pounds in investment in recent years It has ambitious plans for further investment of 1 5 billion in the next 10 to 15 years starting with ambitious plans for Gateshead quays and the Baltic quarter to develop a major new state of the art conference centre and performance arena There are to be exciting ancillary facilities and we hope even a new railway station to service the development as well as our excellent and outstanding Gateshead College I am proud to have been a member of Gateshead Council for 27 years during our process of moving the borough forward on a long line of flagship projects the iconic Sage Gateshead the turning of the Baltic flour mill into a gallery of contemporary art and our Gateshead millennium bridge across the Tyne to the village across the river Members on both sides of the House will recognise the importance of sensitive investment and development in our communities and how that often acts as a driver for regeneration We have a long standing flagship projects policy that started in the 1970s with the Gateshead stadium and Brendan Foster Who could ever forget the way in which we turned Gateshead into a hub of athletics We were an exemplar of Britain in bloom We built the Metrocentre with John Hall and Cameron Hall Developments We turned the old Derwenthaugh coke works site into a wonderful country park We built our civic centre in Gateshead which was a huge success because we brought the project in vastly under budget meaning that the residue of the development grant we got from Government via Lord Bellwin was then used as a sort of development fund That allowed us to do so many different things We turned Saltwell park an ageing Victorian municipal park into the people s park and it became the favourite park in the north of England it was voted the best park in Britain on two occasions We also developed Gateshead quays built the Angel of the North and redeveloped Gateshead town centre Although members of my political persuasion believe that investment for regeneration should come directly from Government because that works I also recognise that there is more chance of me watching Newcastle United win the premier league next year than this Government changing course on public investment in the regeneration of areas in the north east of England which sadly continue to be left behind as the unemployment statistics show graphically If any Member has a spare million or two burning a hole in their pockets I would be delighted to welcome them to Gateshead for a look around to meet the people and see the massive potential that exists they will be given a very warm welcome and be under no illusion that it is a great place to work invest and live As I touched upon earlier council tax takes up an ever increasing proportion of people s income We have all seen the reports of local authorities pursuing residents through the courts with bailiffs to recover insignificant sums of outstanding tax adding significant charges and fees and misery in the process I am therefore delighted to talk about the excellent work that my local authority is doing to identify and support some of our most vulnerable residents The Thrive initiative uses council tax arrears as one of the trigger points for increased support If residents fall into arrears with council tax it is often a tell tale sign that there may be other significant issues on which they need support As a result instead of multiplying debt through the recovery process and causing no end of distress to constituents the Thrive team in Gateshead contacts residents who fall into arrears to offer them additional support We know all too well that very often those in our communities who are most in need are the least likely to seek help or even to know where to go to for help The Thrive initiative does that work for them it reaches out and tries to engage proactively with residents who may be having difficulties with the aim of preventing the situation deteriorating Not only is this holistically an excellent initiative giving assistance before people reach the point of crisis but it is actually beneficial to the people themselves and financially beneficial to the council So I congratulate Gateshead Council on developing such schemes in the most difficult economic circumstances I feel that I have spoken for long enough but although this does not directly affect my constituency it would be remiss of me not to mention the ongoing abandonment of British Steel We wish every success to all initiatives to try to retain steel production in this country as this is so vital While I was growing up I watched deindustrialisation along the Tyne with the loss of shipbuilding and heavy engineering and the closure of coal mines so we need to do something to retain a strategically vital industry here in Britain Time and time again we have seen Governments allow the deindustrialisation of the north of England which has devastating long term effects on communities some of which will never recover It is about time that industries that are vital to not only our economy nationally but our local economies workers and their families across the UK were afforded the same protections as those in the square mile in the City of London We managed to find 500 billion to bail out the City after the financial crash so we must be able to find a few hundred million pounds to save vital industries for the future strategic interest of our country Mr Deputy Speaker I wish you Members on both sides of the House and all staff a very restful Whitsun we all deserve it

Again should the Secretary of State determine to do that a statutory instrument which would come before the House for consideration would be required to cancel the canvass in 2010 Parliament would therefore be able to monitor the Secretary of State s decision That statutory instrument would be taken in Committee and could be referred to and debated on the Floor of the House It would be voted on by the House I am simply saying to all Members that the Secretary of State has the ability to override the recommendation should he or she wish to do so I would not have included in the Bill the ability to have a canvas in 2010 if we did not feel that that was needed We now envisage that there will be one in 2010 and on a 10 year basis after that unless the chief electoral officer recommends otherwise which it is in his power to do again I emphasise that that would be difficult for the Secretary of State to overturn

I have tried to be careful today to recognise that this was the act of a previous Government and it is for them principally to explain why they took the decisions they did I have also tried to be careful because this is not my report it is Sir John Chilcot s report and the first thing we have to do is to read it carefully and to take into account what it finds I have tried very faithfully in my statement to reflect what he says and the way he says it with all the nuances rather than simply to rip out some punchy bits that either damn or praise the then Government because I do not think that that is my responsibility My responsibility is to handle the publication to draw out the lessons which I think I have done and to let others who were responsible at the time account for themselves

I am grateful to the hon Gentleman Perhaps we can clarify the situation The shadow Chancellor in a speech to the Conservative party conference on 1 October said The report from John Redwood and Simon Wolfson sets out how we liberate our economy to compete with the likes of India and China Cut government regulation planning restriction and red tape On 20 August on the ITV1 lunchtime news the Leader of the Opposition said that the report was the most impressive and comprehensive analysis of the state of the British economy produced by any political party and a great report Is that not the case

I beg to move That this House has considered the use of corporate structures in the UK and money laundering tax evasion and other financial crime It gives me pleasure to introduce the debate and to thank the many Members from all parties who proposed it to the Backbench Business Committee which we also thank for granting us the time for it Perhaps in anticipation of it earlier this week the Financial Conduct Authority made by far its strongest ever comment including those of its predecessor organisation the Financial Services Authority about the banks and so on As a relevant introduction to the debate let me quote Tracey McDermott head of enforcement at the FSA who this week said that banks trade finance businesses remained particularly vulnerable to abuse by criminals and terrorists and that in some cases the shipments being funded by lenders were just fresh air Martin Wheatley the new chief executive of the FCA warned that organised criminal gangs filtered cleaned and rebottled 10 billion in the UK every year using banks and other financial services

We have heard much this afternoon particularly from the Liberal Democrats of the virtues of taking tea with people who change their point of view to one s own point of view The Foreign Secretary is having tea with Mr Shalom this afternoon and I wish him luck The last time I as chair of the Inter Parliamentary Union middle east committee had tea with Mr Shalom was in Tel Aviv He had been perfectly pleasant until I mentioned Palestinian prisoners but then unfortunately he almost leapt over the dining room table to get me by the throat So I sincerely hope the Foreign Secretary is luckier than I am but I suspect that he will not be My right hon Friend and neighbour the Member for Pontypridd Dr Howells and I disagree about very little except perhaps the leadership of the Welsh Assembly on which we profoundly disagree I should like to follow up on some of the points that he made but I want to spend the time available today talking about Iraq For the first time in many years the Queen s Speech did not mention Iraq The complex issues relating to that country have dominated so many debates questions and speeches in the House in recent years and I feel that it is important to use this moment to highlight the important progress that has been made and to remind the House of some of the issues that still need further attention I spoke to President Talabani of Iraq when he was here in London recently to attend the very moving memorial service for UK troops who had been involved in operations there I was struck by the fact that despite all the difficulties that Iraq has faced since the overthrow of Saddam the President retains an unwavering belief that it was the right thing to do It is clear from talking to him and almost any other Iraqi that ultimately only they can solve Iraq s problems The role of the UK and coalition forces was to get them to the point at which they had a realistic prospect of success I have full confidence in the determination of the Government and the people of Iraq to ensure that the country continues on its path to stability Iraq s internal dynamics have changed significantly over the past 18 months and I believe that it is now a nation that has changed for the better There have been significant improvements on security the economy and politics Millions of Iraqis now have control over their own destiny The Iraqi people have embraced democracy with great enthusiasm The parliamentary elections in December 2005 saw a turnout of around 80 per cent and provincial elections were held successfully in January this year again with a very high turnout National elections are due to take place in January 2010 and will provide another opportunity for Iraqis to embrace democracy The Iraqi Parliament and the Council of Representatives are both steadily maturing as a voice for the people There are difficulties and delays in passing a new electoral law to regulate the next elections and the composition of the new Iraqi Parliament Again however 25 per cent of the places are going to be set aside for women which is a point worth making here It is another welcome sign that difficulties are being battled out in the political arena rather than on the streets The attempts by some to throw progress off course as seen in the terrible bomb attacks on key ministries in Baghdad in August and October have not had their desired impact The response from Iraqis has been to deal with matters in a mature and considered manner I sincerely hope that all the main political leaders in Iraq will continue to work together in a spirit of compromise and for the interests of all Iraq Not doing so risks damaging the recent gains in security and political progress It is clear that many challenges remain in ensuring peace and stability in Iraq Starting from such a low base it is inevitable that work remains to bring about an effective human rights culture in Iraq In my continuing role as the Prime Minister s special envoy on human rights in Iraq I continue to engage with a wide range of Iraqis both here and in Iraq to help this process along I urge those I meet to continue to focus their efforts on ensuring that the rule of law is respected The number of detainees held without trial has dropped considerably over the past 18 months but sustained effort to ensure that those remaining are either released or made to face trial is needed All those subject to the Iraqi legal system should be dealt with in a timely and humane manner Freedom of expression was an area that suffered greatly under Saddam Since 2003 a vibrant media reflecting a wide spectrum of views has sprung up There are signs of some efforts to curb the effectiveness of the media with new regulations and legislation under consideration This is a subject that I intend to raise when I visit Iraq shortly and meet key activists working to protect the rights of journalists I discussed the challenges faced by the media in Iraq at one of the programmes of ongoing human rights forums or round tables held by the Foreign Office this year which I chaired Industry in Iraq continues to recover and international trade links are being re established British companies assisted by UK Trade Investment are showing more interest in doing business in Iraq To support their efforts the UKTI staff in our diplomatic missions in Iraq have been bolstered BP and the Iraqi Government signed a new deal earlier this month to help revitalise the Rumaila oil field in southern Iraq which should dramatically increase oil production and revenue for the Iraqi Government There is much work still to be done to protect the rights of Iraqi workers The British TUC which I thank very much continues to assist in many ways There remain in place many Saddam era regulations restricting the rights of trade unions and preventing public sector workers from joining the union of their choosing I am pleased to hear that a campaign launched by the Iraqi permanent co ordination committee of trade unions and professional associations is gathering momentum I note with some satisfaction that on 13 November President Talabani himself signed up to their campaign calling for more equitable labour laws I have raised from the start concerns about the treatment of women in Iraqi society Women continue to face many problems in their day to day lives Article 41 of the constitution could seriously affect the rights of women and I hope it will be revisited in the ongoing constitutional discussions So called honour based violence has been reported as on the increase in many parts of Iraq This is not a religious or an Islamic practice but something rooted in the traditions of the clans and tribes I have encouraged the leadership in Iraq particularly the Kurds in the north to speak out against it and to treat any honour crime just like any other crime The considerable abilities of the new Kurdish Prime Minister Barham Salih he has visited this House several times will I think be used to good effect in Iraqi Kurdistan and I am sure that we would all want to send our good wishes to him He has been an excellent Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq and I am sure that the Kurds will benefit from having him as Prime Minister of Iraqi Kurdistan I plan to visit Iraq again before the end of the year and am sure that as in each of my previous visits since 2003 I will see further evidence of improvements I know I will meet Iraqis who are committed to the future of their country and to seeing peace and prosperity I know I will meet such people because they form the overwhelming majority of the population I am sure that they will be pleased to hear that Iraq is no longer such a regular source of bad news and that they will not be at all offended that this year they did not even get a mention from Her Majesty the Queen in her Gracious Speech I finish with a short announcement On 1 December our present ambassador in Iraq will be coming here to answer questions The Foreign Minister will also be present as will the chargé d affaires from the Iraqi embassy I hope that those interested in Iraq will come along on 1 December to ask any questions that I have not been able to answer today

I am aware of that case Indeed in opposition and as a constituency Member in the north west I was part of the combination of Members of Parliament who sought the truth of what happened in that scandalous situation My hon Friend can rest assured that with all such scandals the Government review issues relating to pension protection The whole point of Myners was to ensure that we had a transparent pensions system and a regulatory regime that fits the needs of not only the industry but its customers We will have to await the outcome of the case before I can say anything specific but I will be happy to meet him about it when it has been determined

My hon Friend is absolutely right There are all sorts of boroughs across London and some areas are funded to the tune of tens of thousands of pounds less per classroom than one that might be just a short distance away yet they are in exactly the same market for teachers the vital ingredient for raising educational standards Despite that when it comes to improving standards outer London has been part of the London educational transformation The suggestion that moving from a situation of gross inequity to one that is fairer to all will undermine quality when those who have suffered that inequity such as the constituents of my hon Friend the Member for Hornchurch and Upminster Dame Angela Watkinson have none the less managed to improve standards proves that the issue is not just about money The money needs to be distributed fairly I think the most important thing we should do today as a House is to say that we want a system that is fair to all We should be discussing the principles and ensuring that the Government do not wriggle on any them for their own partisan or other interests That is quite right but let us not scaremonger Let us not send out messages about dividing communities when the aim of fair funding is right and supported by everyone including the Labour Conservative and other major Front Bench teams I shall end there

I can certainly confirm that the Department of Health has repeatedly provided advice on that matter Of course the hon Gentleman makes a very fair point in saying that the smallpox vaccination carries a risk of side effects so it is important that it be used only in circumstances in which the risk of infection is greater than that of side effects That is why the plans of the Department of Health and the Government for dealing with any smallpox outbreak involve vaccination of those who would be most at risk rather than general vaccination It is very important that we keep the matter in proportion and do not unnecessarily alarm our constituents so I repeat that we are not aware at present of any specific threat of a smallpox attack on Britain

That is a very interesting point There should certainly be an aggravating feature of the offence of theft Unfortunately that is not the case according to the Sentencing Council s guidelines That is what is missing Dogs are stolen in burglaries for a multitude of reasons for fighting for ransoms for breeding or for selling on This crime is increasing and the emotional impact it has on both the owner and the dogs is immeasurable Anyone who has had a dog stolen from them is able to say how painful an experience it is for both the owner and the animal yet I fear penalties will now be reduced rather than increased This is due to the flawed sentencing guidelines introduced just last month Under the guidelines theft sentencing is split into three categories high medium and lesser culpability These are defined by specific characteristics However none of those characteristics includes anything that would normally apply for the theft of a dog This forms the very starting point for sentencing The guidelines then go on to look at the harm caused which does cover emotional distress to the victim but is assessed primarily by the financial loss to the victim That cannot be the right approach

I want to speak in response to the right hon Member for Don Valley Caroline Flint who is no longer in her place She said that her constituents felt insulted Well in the debates around these really crucial issues some of those who voted another way also feel insulted They are called remoaners they are called traitors and they are called mutineers The lords who have crafted some very sensible amendments have been attacked for doing their constitutional job Quite frankly we need to have a much more serious debate about the future of this country and our future relationship with Europe The reality is that I accept that we are leaving When I hear myself described in the press as a remainer or a remoaner or whatever other adjective they want to give me I have to say that I accept the referendum result but what I do not accept is the massive damage that would be caused by a hard Brexit It would damage my constituents jobs it would damage their futures and I will not support it I say that loud and clear For those reasons I do support the Government s amendment tonight on the customs agreement That was something that I stood on in my manifesto I thought that it was sensible and showed that the Government were willing to negotiate with Europe build a positive relationship and more importantly not junk those economic and cultural ties that are so important to my constituents The EEA is not the perfect answer but it is the framework from which we should work I know that there are concerns around immigration The reality is that it is freedom of movement of workers in the EEA and not freedom of movement so there is already a big shift We do not as a country apply the immigration controls that we could do Much of the resentment that has been spoken about by Labour Members was caused by the Labour Government s failure to apply the brake on the accession countries when they estimated that 12 000 to 15 000 people would come in from Europe we had just under a million That is why there has been that big groundswell of resentment There are some very sensible and pragmatic solutions out there and I want to see this Government tackling them and looking at some of the options The EEA is a framework that Europe understands We should accept some of that framework and negotiate the opt outs where we need them and shape the agreement for the future

My right hon Friend will be aware that South Birmingham primary care trust is one of the better managed PCTs that has kept to budget and contributed to improvements in patient care Indeed some of the local hospitals such as University hospital also have a good financial record Although they and I understand the logic behind the reserve and the fact that they will need to contribute to it does she understand that they need some more reassurance that while the much needed improvements that they have planned may be delayed somewhat they need to come on stream so that their health needs and the needs of those communities which are often uneven but nevertheless very severe will be addressed and so that they will not have to wait an unreasonable time for that to happen

It was with profound sadness that I saw my constituency this week join the all too long list of areas across our country to have lost a precious young person to knife crime The public do not want to see politicians throw blame at one another for these stolen lives they want to see them take responsibility for what is within their control provide resource if resource is necessary and then demonstrate a relentless and total commitment to snuffing out violent crime I welcome the announcement of an emergency summit but what action will the Prime Minister be taking after that constantly to drive performance on these issues until we get the result the public rightly demand to keep children safe

One thing that this debate has achieved is to remind us of the great breadth of DEFRA s responsibilities the environment food and rural affairs Unfortunately farming is not mentioned in the title and yet it is essential to so many of the Department s activities In that context I remind the House of the interest I have declared in the register I want to start by referring to some of the Secretary of State s remarks There is no contradiction between recognising rightly the expertise knowledge enthusiasm and commitment of individual members of his staff and our overall concerns about the lack of co ordination direction and management that have given rise to the perception which so many of my hon Friends have referred to that the Department is as my hon Friend the Member for North East Cambridgeshire Mr Moss said not fit for purpose I thought at one stage in the Secretary of State s litany of what he claimed as successes that he was going to claim credit for the non flooding of eastern England following the surge that did not quite happen a few weeks ago I can just remember the 1953 floods I was a very small child living on the Suffolk coast and they were horrendous However we should not do anything other than thank goodness that they were not repeated The Department cannot take the credit or criticism because thankfully the defences and the plans were not properly tested I also want to refer briefly to foot and mouth We have already had an Opposition day debate on that subject so I do not intend to spend a great deal of time on it In response to the hon Member for Carlisle Mr Martlew in that debate I said that of course the Government had learned the lessons of 2001 God forbid that they had not because as he and others have said it is almost impossible to imagine the situation being any worse than it was at that time The Secretary of State made no reference to the 50 million overspend on administration which the permanent secretary described to the Select Committee a week or so ago When it comes to cutting the number of staff the Secretary of State referred to meeting the head count targets but said nothing to explain why those staff were taken on in the first place if they are supernumerary to requirements If they are required why are we getting rid of them Most importantly having to make in year cuts demonstrates the incompetence of management Invariably those cuts can be met only by cutting expenditure at the front line not letting contracts that have not yet been let and not carrying out front line functions because we all know that cutting staff does not save money in the year that one does it because of all the associated costs My hon Friend the Member for North East Cambridgeshire and my hon and learned Friend the Member for Torridge and West Devon Mr Cox made it absolutely clear that the perception of DEFRA on the ground in farming is very different from that which the Secretary of State described to the House They both described cases in their constituencies where incompetence and bureaucracy got in the way of the farmers going about their business The hon Member for Bridgend Mrs Moon for whom I have a lot of respect when it comes to environmental issues rightly talked about the importance of biodiversity I agree with a great deal of what she said I thought that she had to scrape the barrel to find a criticism to make of the previous Conservative Government It was that Government who introduced the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 a major trail blazing piece of legislation on which much legislation has recently been based That Government also introduced environmentally sensitive areas and the pilot environmental stewardship schemes on which the right hon Member for Scunthorpe Mr Morley built when he took up ministerial responsibilities

I welcome the opportunity to participate in this evening s debate I agree entirely that this has been a debate of a very high standard and many right hon and hon Members have spoken with considerable passion At a personal level I should say how much I admire the contribution made by the hon Member for Montgomeryshire Lembit Öpik I know how difficult it must be for him to be here today and say from his many friends in Northern Ireland that we very much appreciate the contribution that he has made to the debate today I cannot say the same to the hon Member for Ochil and South Perthshire Gordon Banks who will not be surprised by that Whenever he ascends to the high office to which he undoubtedly aspires I hope that he realises that some things in life are more important than political ambition There are high principles in politics and justice that are worth preserving and his contribution to this debate did nothing to persuade any of us that he understands those principles in the context of the Bill I hope that he will take the time to come to Northern Ireland and meet some of the victims groups and I certainly intend to send a copy of his speech to all the victims groups with which I am in contact The central theme of his speech was It is time to move on and get over it I hope that he will have the courage of his convictions and visit Northern Ireland to tell people that to their faces I do not think that he has the slightest understanding of the hurt and pain that the Bill is causing in Northern Ireland I echo the comments of the hon Member for North Down Lady Hermon who spoke with considerable passion about the sense of injustice felt by RUC widows I know that many of the other victims in Northern Ireland such as the families of police officers and of Ulster Defence Regiment Royal Irish Regiment and Army soldiers share that sense of injustice Indeed the issue is not confined to Northern Ireland because the families of soldiers who served in Northern Ireland have been denied justice too As my hon Friend the Member for Belfast East Mr Robinson reminded us many hundreds of civilians also lost their lives in the course of the troubles As has been said the issue was not included in the Belfast agreement I was involved in the negotiations leading up to the agreement which I voted against for a number of reasons including the provisions on the early release of terrorist prisoners Nowhere in the agreement is there a justification for the Bill Indeed in an earlier response to an intervention the Secretary of State acknowledged that the deal that he has done with Sinn Fein does not emanate from the agreement although the Prime Minister has sought to draw such parallels The argument has been advanced that the Bill is unfinished business and that we need it to achieve closure but I respectfully inform the Secretary of State that in my opinion it will not achieve closure for many of the victims in Northern Ireland Last Thursday evening my hon Friend the Member for Upper Bann David Simpson and I met a large number of victims from south Armagh and Fermanagh which are the areas with the largest number of unsolved murders in Northern Ireland Hundreds of murders in which the perpetrators have not been brought to justice were committed in south Armagh and Fermanagh I do not like to single out individuals but may I say how much I admire Miss Aileen Quinton s contribution to this debate She lost her mother in the poppy day massacre in Enniskillen in 1987 which the Chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee the hon Member for South Staffordshire Sir Patrick Cormack mentioned earlier I have heard Aileen conduct radio interviews and she has shared her views in the national media with considerable dignity The strength of her argument on this issue is unanswerable Aileen like so many of the victims who have suffered as a result of the troubles in Northern Ireland feels that she will suffer doubly because of the injustice caused by this Bill We want a process of healing in Northern Ireland so that we can move forward I would say to the hon Member for Ochil and South Perthshire that I want to move forward but I do not want us to trample over the rights of victims in our haste to do so We must bring people with us Dealing with the sense of injustice is part of the process of healing Peace is not created by injustice The problem with the Bill is that it will lead to injustice Some of the victims this was expressed to us very clearly when we met victims groups will be re traumatised as a result of this process There is indignation that the perpetrators can remain anonymous throughout the process and do not have to appear before a tribunal to account for their crimes It is an aberration to describe that as justice or due process That simply does not wash with people in Northern Ireland I am afraid that the legacy of the Bill will be that murder intimidation and terrorism have proved successful for individuals who have engaged in such activities The Secretary of State made it clear that the purpose of the Bill is to meet a demand that has been made by Sinn Fein IRA That demand is coming from nowhere else but one source and one source only I accept that not only Her Majesty s Government but the Irish Government are party to the agreement that has been reached The Irish Government are happy to support a deal that permits the murderers of RUC officers to walk free yet say in their own jurisdiction that the men who murdered Garda Jerry McCabe will not benefit from the process The hypocrisy of that position shows the extent to which double standards are applied in dealing with Sinn Fein IRA Of course I do not wish the murderers of Jerry McCabe to benefit I have met Garda McCabe s widow a fine woman who has shown much courage in highlighting her case in the Irish Republic Today we met the widows and family members of RUC officers who were murdered and they cannot understand why that double standard should apply

I will give way to the Minister in a moment On 11 March 2008 the current Mayor of London told the Home Affairs Committee crime continued to rise until 2003 since then it has fallen by 21 per cent Let me put that in its historical context According to the Home Office figures which are there for all to see I say that for the benefit of the hon Member for Edmonton Mr Love there were just under 130 000 recorded offences of violence against the person in London in 1998 99 Guess what the figure was in 2006 07 it was 182 000 That is an increase of 40 per cent according to Home Office figures In 1998 99 there were 26 000 robberies in London Guess how many there were in 2006 07 well over 45 000 That is an increase of over 74 per cent

I can give the hon Gentleman an absolute assurance because the coalition agreement states our commitment to taking forward the findings of the Pitt review on the 2007 floods We are considering how best to put this into effect against the difficult spending background and as he will have heard earlier from my hon Friend the Under Secretary of State for Environment Food and Rural Affairs this year because the Environment Agency was ahead of the game with the amount of flood defences it had provided there is no question of this important front line service being compromised In the spending review we will of course give priority to flood defences

I am tempted in Kevin McCloud fashion to say Will I actually get to the end of this speech and will it be done by Christmas Let s come back after the break and see More seriously my honourable neighbour makes an important point which I shall try to cover on the basis of what little I know about this field It is indeed important not to look at individuals of high net worth to do the self build which would simply not be possible in my constituency Rather we should look to local partnerships particularly including local councils I have alluded to the experience of Berlin to which I shall return but in my own area the superb Nottingham City Homes is the arm s length management organisation for the former council housing stock It is very well led with imagination and creativity in abundance If we can tie such organisations to people in the private sector who are prepared to help I think it will be possible to bridge from those high end individual self builds into something that could have a real impact on my constituents I say that for another reason too not necessarily for the obvious housing reason This could be a demonstration and a symbol of the fact that people in areas decimated by the decline of manufacturing who have been pulverised by the loss of employment in their communities and in many cases the loss of self respect as well are capable of getting up organising and achieving something like this That could have a really cathartic effect on those estates with which I know the hon Gentleman is so familiar I pay tribute to Ted Stevens whose name has been mentioned Ted is not simply the chair of the National Self Build Association One cannot come into contact with Ted without being electrocuted by the passion and desire he brings to this field He is an inspirational character and we were fortunate that he chose to come to Nottingham recently to convene a meeting with a number of colleagues who are interested in this field One cannot pay for that sort of passion or buy that sort of interest and desire to spread the word If with the hon Member for South Norfolk and Ted Stevens he is no longer the chair of the association but he is not the sort of character who is going to leave the field we can bottle that passion there is a real chance of doing something very significant in this field Let me say a little more about the specifics in relation to my own constituency which I know the Bill s promoter is concerned about too If we are to make an impact on the market we are going to have to look at how this will impact on the former council estates on working class and low income housing which is where much of the expansion could come from I made a point earlier about having more devolution so that local government can make some decisions rather than be the passive recipient of policies coming down the pipe from Whitehall In my constituency we need to enable the local authority to get on and do the job it sees fit Peculiarly there is too much housing in my constituency The project I am fortunate enough to chair in my constituency is called the rebalancing project It is called that because we are trying to balance the fact that 95 of the constituency is covered by former council estates with very little provided in the way of employment training leisure all the things that go to make an effective community To balance that we have to confront the reality of being issued with housing targets that are wholly inappropriate for a constituency such as mine and the drive in local government when battling austerity to sell land assets often to people who could put a semi on a corner or a Barrett estate on a zone designated for business and enterprise losing that land for ever Those pressures must be considered We need a much more flexible system one that is looked at locally rather than one in which all we are doing is looking to tick the boxes sent to us by the centre If we can have that degree of flexibility there will be room and possibilities for self build custom build and community build breaking in my case this unleavened sea of former council housing I put on record that this is actually very good stock brick built houses from the new garden city movement era with gardens front and back and pitched roofs with no deck access and no high rise but which none the less in modern circumstances without the employers who were around at that time creates a large single problem verging on a ghetto which we need to break down in order to create communities and neighbourhoods on a more human scale based on a balance of employment skills and training I was inveigled by the hon Gentleman to go to Berlin to have a look at some of the self build or community build there It was one of the best bits of inveigling I have ever experienced This was not Grand Designs as a concept Some of the buildings we saw were converted There was a beautiful former school which had been made into a wonderful set of apartments for a broad based mix of people with plenty of facilities on site The other buildings that we saw were flats sets of housing rather than individual housing That visit opened my eyes to the fact that it was not necessary to do a one off in a green field I realised that this was relevant in an urban context and relevant to more than just an individual and that it could start to involve a more collective approach that could be the answer in areas such as mine

I agree wholeheartedly with my right hon Friend but I emphasise my concern that historically there have been occasions when filibustering whether by the Government or the Opposition was the order of the day That is something that I deeply regret However if the House is to do its job it is essential that adequate time be allocated for proper and full detailed scrutiny of legislation

I am very happy to do that I shall run through the elements in the package Let us suppose for the sake of argument and for ease of estimate that the local income tax rate in a particular local authority is 4p A reduction of 4p in the national basic rate of income tax would therefore equate to 4p going on to local income tax in a local authority area The net effect of that has to be zero I am sure that the Minister would accept that The net effect of the national basic rate coming down by 4p and the local income tax going up 4p has to be nil That change has nil effect We then need to take into account the effect of closing pension tax relief which is by definition only available to higher rate taxpayers who must be better off getting rid of the capital gains tax taper relief which overwhelmingly benefits the better off scrapping the council tax which is a very regressive tax whose abolition will help the poor and then imposing environmental taxes on people who buy large gas guzzlers who tend to be better off and on the most frequent flyers who on average tend to be the better off all those are progressive changes It is impossible to understand how the effect of that whole package can be anything other than progressive the Institute for Fiscal Studies has demonstrated that the only group who lose out is the top decile

It is a great pleasure to follow the right hon Member for Oldham West and Royton Mr Meacher He made a powerful point to which I want to return a little later May I thank you Mr Speaker and the Prime Minister for recalling Parliament Today s debate was absolutely necessary It has been a very good debate Party politics have not been involved Hon Members on both sides of the House have argued different points of view That is what is good about today I have been under no pressure from my Whip to vote one way or the other That is a really good sign Hon Members are wrestling today with a very difficult issue I find these occasions when we have to decide what is morally right and whether or not we will kill people and whether by killing them we save other people in the long run immensely difficult I have made it clear to the Prime Minister that I have not made up my mind tonight and that my decision will rely entirely on the summing up by the Deputy Prime Minister I would like to thank the Deputy Prime Minister for spending much of the afternoon listening to the debate Thank goodness we have a British parliamentary democracy We MPs can come here and influence the decision of the Executive Everybody knows that MPs from both sides of the House have influenced the Prime Minister to change the position of the Executive In the States there are 100 Congressmen begging the President to let them debate the issue We are so much better off in this House In response to what the right hon Member for Oldham West and Royton said the question is indeed what we should do to solve this exceptionally difficult problem because just bombing will not solve it There needs to be a disproportionate response What I think President Obama has done is to have got out The West Wing series and looked at what President Bartlet would have done under the circumstances There is exactly that episode If we bomb Damascus airport we are going to kill thousands of people but they will never do it again Of course the expert then says If you do that the whole world will be against you The President asks Well what do we do and the reply is You just bomb a few buildings which have been emptied because everybody knows which buildings are going to be bombed The President says That will have no effect but the experts say Yes but that is actually what you have to do You have to have a response That may be how it works in America but it does not work like that here I am very interested in one point that I hope the Deputy Prime Minister will help us with tonight If we vote against the motion and both motions happen to be lost does it mean that there is no guarantee that there will be a second vote in this House

As my colleagues and I have indicated the Department is having to make difficult and painful decisions and very few parts of our Department or its delivery agencies are unaffected The budget cuts made to British Waterways this year pale into insignificance however when set against its overall increase in funding in recent years I am somewhat surprised by the hon Gentleman s advocating British Waterways having money as I think that I am right in saying that he was one of a number of Conservative Members who opposed British Waterways making money from commercial development last year at Wood Wharf in London

I assure you that I will keep to that limit Mr Deputy Speaker Every 15 minutes someone in the UK is told that they are losing or have permanently lost their sight That leaves them with a sense of bewilderment and they often ask themselves what will happen next In January 2011 I underwent an emergency operation to repair a torn retina in my right eye If the operation had not taken place I would have lost the sight in that eye Back in September I again experienced the same trauma in my other eye which also required surgery A possible side effect of the retina vitrectomy operations that I received is a cataract In my case the operations caused a partial one in the right eye and more recently a full one in my left eye As a result of my first experience I became actively involved with several sight related issues in Parliament I spoke in an Adjournment debate on the use of Avastin in age related macular degradation I campaigned for oral warnings on silent hybrid vehicles and I sought to change the law so that an attack on a guide dog is considered as an attack on its owner I welcomed the opportunity to open the Optegra eye hospital in Colindale in my constituency I have urged constituents to have regular eye and sight tests and I have lobbied Barnet clinical commissioning group to ensure there are enough funds to cover the demand for cataract operations I want to raise the issue of eye clinic liaison officers Across England ECLOs help patients and their families to understand their diagnosis when someone loses their sight They provide information and support including referrals to other services However only 30 of eye clinics in the UK currently have some kind of qualified support My constituents in Hendon are covered by the Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust Three hospitals in the area have an ophthalmology department Barnet hospital Edgware community hospital and the Royal Free hospital First Edgware community hospital does not have an ECLO but it is a very small clinic Although I would not necessarily call for an ECLO to be based there it should certainly have access to one Secondly there is no qualified sight loss adviser service at Barnet hospital although early intervention support is provided by the Hertfordshire Society for the Blind to which we are grateful Finally as far as I am aware the Royal Free hospital does not have a sight loss adviser service During my regular visits to Moorfields eye hospital I have witnessed the pressure that ophthalmology departments are under During 2011 12 in England alone the number of out patient appointments for ophthalmology totalled 6 8 million making it the third largest hospital service in terms of attendances The demand for ophthalmology services will continue because the number of people with sight loss is set to increase Recent research conducted with health care professionals in Wales has shown that sight loss advisers reduce the number of follow up appointments through the immediate and ongoing support that they offer which saves the NHS money in the longer term On three occasions I have sat in hospitals on my own facing the reality that I could lose my sight a prospect that is frightening for anyone Sight loss has a huge impact on the lives of those who suffer it and on their families I believe that the expansion of ECLOs across the country would be a comparatively small financial price to pay for a service whose benefit cannot be measured in monetary terms According to the Royal National Institute of Blind People 66 of registered blind or partially sighted people of working age are not in employment Two thirds of working age or employed people with sight loss experience restrictions in accessing and fully participating in employment That is a great loss on many levels Unsurprisingly almost half of the public in another recent poll expected that emotional counselling would be available if they discovered that they were going to become blind Sadly that is not the case I find it ironic that I stand here today knowing that tomorrow I and several hundred other people will again face the prospect of losing our eyesight without any clinical support Some people will have corneal replacements some will have vitreo retinal procedures and some will have glaucoma operations or canaloplasty I expect to have cataract operations on both eyes As I said cataracts are a side effect of retina vitrectomy operations There is now a clinical need to operate on both my eyes In conclusion it is clear that sight loss can have a devastating and profound impact on a person s life and it is shocking that people are left to face it on their own The general public expect practical and emotional support to be available to people who are losing their sight No one should have to return home on their own not understanding their sight condition not knowing what support is out there and left isolated Sight loss advisers provide a bridge between health and social care and ensure that patients receive the support and information that they need to be independent and to learn the skills that they need in order to adapt to losing their sight The service is cost effective and benefits the clinic by ensuring that patients receive the necessary support which results in clinicians being able to focus on treating and diagnosing patients Today I want to join the call of the RNIB for every eye department in the UK to have access to a sight loss adviser and for those vital posts to be funded permanently We need to ensure that no one is left to face sight loss on their own

Speaking as an ex serviceman I watched the atrocities in Paris and noted that the police there who were already armed were expected to enter the buildings immediately to rescue people There was no time to hang around My concern is whether we have sufficient funding and training facilities to ensure that those who find themselves in such a situation here God forbid are equipped to enter such buildings immediately It costs a lot more money to equip and train people to that level of expertise

This is the first time that I have had the privilege and honour to take part in a fisheries debate I shall use this opportunity briefly to place on record my view that it is time for the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union s common fisheries policy It is time for an independent British fishing policy made to suit the local interests of our country I agree with much that has been said in the Chamber this afternoon Much has been said with more eloquence than I could put it about the failures of the CFP Members have told us that after decades of the CFP there are fewer fish and fewer fishermen and that fishing fleets have dwindled Other Members spoke about the high cost of the CFP to the taxpayer By almost any measure the policy has been a failure In my constituency there was a thriving fishing industry before the Europeanisation of our fishing policy Before I was born many people earned a good living from the sea but that has almost all gone The fish the fishing fleets the livelihoods have all disappeared If I am honest I must say that that happened under Governments of both parties Something is fundamentally wrong with the way we manage fisheries in this country

I will not Mrs Heal I am sure that there will be another day for that However let us not hide the facts It was our Government who decided to go ahead with the liberalisation but that is the European Union agenda and we have to fight wherever we can to ensure that it goes no further None of my constituents has ever contacted me calling for this process of liberalisation in postal services for the undermining of the universal service obligation or for further branch closures but I believe that that is the agenda of the European Union as promoted in this treaty and constitution Giving away further powers to the EU in relation to this crucial public service is to use a cliché like making wolves protectors of lambs I have not found many who want this change Sub postmasters and postmistresses do not want it the Communication Workers Union does not want it and I believe that the majority of MPs do not want it either The amendment would send a signal and put a brake on this process that is happening above our heads It would establish the right of Members to have some say on the future of public services which our constituents continue to need I have one more thing to say about post offices and the EU I will not go back to my walk to the post office Mrs Heal in doing so A lady said to me this morning that she would like to ask me a question and it was a question that different people have raised in other ways She asked why if the Government can spend 110 billion 3 500 for each of us to keep a bank with 2 million customers afloat they cannot pay 5 from each taxpayer to support a post office network with 11 4 million customers We know that they will not do that because the European Union does not want us to do it Other countries do it and get away with it but we seem to sit back and allow all these things to flow over our heads That is why it is so important that we have a long debate on the referendum tomorrow I hope that many of my colleagues who may not have wanted to vote for a referendum will decide that it is one way of showing that they mean to get power back and take control over what is happening to our public services

Prison capacity may be increasing but the Minister is surely aware that the present chronic lack of spaces has led to dangerous prisoners being taken out of closed prisons and put into the camp at Prescoed from which they immediately escape Will he undertake to return to the Justice Minister and demand that enough spaces are built in the closed estate to ensure that people living near open prisons such as Prescoed can sleep safely in their beds at night

Is my right hon Friend certain about what he is saying about pensioners I think there is a popular misconception along the lines he is describing My understanding from pensioner constituents is that a pensioner must have an income of over 22 000 to gain from the measure and that anyone with an income below that amount will be worse off

I do not want to interfere in private banter but I draw the hon Gentleman s attention to the fact that in 2009 the person who is now Chancellor he was then shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury condemned any concept of rules In the rule that he eventually helped to develop in opposition and that eventually came into force there was a welfare cap that has now been completely disregarded The deficit was meant to be not reduced but eliminated by 2015 with a reduction in debt The rules seem to have gone out the window very early for this Chancellor

I agree and I know that that was in the NHS plan Commitments to make all sorts of changes are of absolutely no value unless action follows In the current GP contract there is the minimum practice income guarantee which pays sums based on historic funding levels for GP practices The NHS Confederation concludes that the way in which that works disadvantages practices in deprived communities Why was the contract negotiated in a way that had that result

The hon Gentleman should understand that I am not asking him to take lessons from me but from the British Thoracic Society I am sure that even those former miners would take the view that the fact that they have been given compensation does not mean that they should not receive the highest quality health services Of course they should and that is what we are arguing for To tackle health inequalities we require a focus on the evidence of the disease group from which those inequalities come on the behavioural and environmental factors and on an understanding that relative inequalities will not necessarily be overcome even if at the same time we like countries across the world improve aggregate health outcomes As in the debate about Herceptin if it is a national health service the national part demands equitable access to services It should not be distorted by the centre s failure to understand what clinical criteria should be applied on a consensual basis or by distorted funding from the Government to try to advantage some areas of the country If we do all those things and improve the public health environment I hope that in years to come a new Conservative Government will bring our reports back to the House and show that we have tackled and reduced health inequality

The universal service obligation is in law to ensure that everybody can access the service by 2020 but that is an end date a deadline As I said earlier we have now reached 93 of premises Crucially that is 93 of premises having access to broadband they still have to take it up In fact everybody who takes up the service in a subsidised area puts more money into the pot so that we can give more people access to superfast broadband Just 42 of the country had superfast broadband in 2010 when my right hon Friend the Member for Wantage took up the reins of delivering it but now 93 have access to it We are on track to get to 95 at the end of the year and then 100 of premises will have access to high speed broadband by 2020 As my hon Friend the Member for Taunton Deane Rebecca Pow can see we are rolling that out Crucially that is delivering today s technology it delivers the needs of an average household today but we also need to make sure we are ahead of the curve on the next generation of technology The idea of the digital investment fund is that it supports the commercial finance of alternative developers so we get more players into the market rather than just having BT and Virgin the two big players The Government s investment will be at least matched on the same terms by private sector investments so we expect it to capitalise more private investment and bring more than 1 billion of investment overall into full fibre broadband getting the really high speeds that some people need and want now but many many more will need and want in the future as these demands increase

I congratulate my hon Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire Gordon Banks on securing this debate He is assiduous in pursuing local issues on behalf of his constituents and he has rightly been very active in this matter on the future of the Defence Aviation Repair Agency and in particular Almondbank He is of course joined in his concerns by the trade unions acting on behalf of DARA s employees and they as well as he have raised issues over time As he has said they have put together alternative proposals for consideration at the invitation of Lord Drayson I have read the trade unions proposals Baroness Taylor has gone through the proposals in detail as has the Secretary of State for Defence As my hon Friend knows we have also talked to him and listened to his advice ideas and representations We have two guiding principles in examining DARA s future which override all other considerations I hope that the House and my hon Friend will agree that those principles are the priorities that should steer our decisions First and foremost are the interests of our armed forces who are involved in difficult and dangerous operations on our behalf and are dependent on the equipment in this case helicopters that we supply them with for their effectiveness and safety We will do nothing that does not protect and potentially enhance our ability to supply our forces effectively now and in the future Our second guiding principle is securing the skills that we have at DARA Short term financial considerations are of little or no value In rotary wing maintenance as elsewhere we need a sustainable skill base in the UK that is capable of meeting our needs over the long term as well as providing quality jobs in constituencies such as that of my hon Friend Those principles underlie the defence industrial strategy They are widely supported in the House and by the trade union movement too Indeed the only people who oppose the principles of the strategy are the free market zealots who believe that the maintenance of industrial capabilities in defence is not important Historically DARA s role has been to provide depth maintenance to repair and to overhaul the fixed wing aircraft of the RAF and the helicopters of all three services In recent years logistical reform has led to the migration of depth repair to our partners in industry including some at the main operating bases Such changes already happen Partnering is working particularly well in the maintenance of our fast jet fleets both Tornado and Harrier There are 11 more Harrier aircraft available to the front line at any one time as they spend less time in depth maintenance because of the partnering arrangements that we have managed to agree to cover that work The time spent in depth maintenance is reduced by 59 per cent allowing us greater capability on the front line As a result of those developments DARA has progressively become less viable Its businesses for fast jets and engines have already closed Its business in Wales having lost its fast jet work now supports only the VC10 DARA s helicopter repair business is based at Fleetlands Hampshire and the associated helicopter components business is based at Almondbank The vast majority of its work is to support the Chinook helicopters as a subcontractor for Boeing and to support Sea King helicopters which it currently undertakes directly for the MOD although it will soon be a subcontractor for AgustaWestland Support for new helicopter platforms such as Merlin and Apache is provided by the manufacturer which provides through life support because of its inherent knowledge of the platforms design and military capabilities As our equipment becomes more complex that is an inevitable trend We will need depth maintenance to be provided by the original manufacturer as it knows the detail of the equipment that it supplies On the basis of its defence work load alone we cannot see how DARA s rotary wing business can remain viable beyond the out of service date of the Sea King helicopter In sharp contrast to our industrial partners DARA holds very little intellectual property or design capability However as a subcontractor it possesses technical know how and as my hon Friend said a highly skilled work force who are extremely capable and committed to supporting operations We must ensure that that capability endures That is what we are about So since late 2005 we have been examining options for the future of these businesses aiming at a solution that best preserves the capability to support the armed forces and secures the long term employment of the work force We looked at both sale and in house options It is not true as some assert that Vector Aerospace was the only interested bidder in fact we received expressions of interest from more than 20 bidders out of which three companies were selected as provisional preferred bidders As the process continued however Vector Aerospace demonstrated that it was best placed to deliver the capability that our armed forces require and to provide longevity of employment to the work force Thus in July 2007 I announced that Vector Aerospace was the preferred bidder for the rotary wing and component businesses My hon Friend asked about consultation with the trade unions I can tell him that throughout the period since 2005 we have been in both formal and informal consultation with them Yes they have raised concerns but it is their job to do so My hon Friend was right to say that the unions have produced their own report but I would not like the House to get the impression that we have not had consultations with them throughout the period Moreover Baroness Taylor is prepared to continue to talk to the trade union movement into the future Despite its relatively small presence in the UK Vector Aerospace has considerable defence experience especially in north America where it provides rotary wing maintenance to the US military Through its UK subsidiary Sigma it already services the MOD s VC10 Conway and Hercules engines and it is seeking to broaden its footprint There are clear indications that there will be future growth in this area and Vector Aerospace has already actively made the necessary approaches to secure further MOD engine business for its UK base There is tacit but substantial support from Boeing and AgustaWestland that Vector Aerospace would be a key link in their performance under future contracting arrangements There are therefore real prospects for investment and for winning future business through commercial and military work In this process we have insisted that the bidder complies with all employment obligations and with the Government s fair deal for staff pensions We will not sell the businesses unless Vector Aerospace complies with those vital employment safeguards Moreover I can tell my hon Friend the Member for Portsmouth North Sarah McCarthy Fry that the protections are identical for both the Fleetlands and Almondbank sites and that they also apply to any subsequent sale of the business to a third party Vector Aerospace has also undertaken to support and take forward the apprentice scheme Vector Aerospace has legally undertaken to retain the businesses in the UK To provide further certainty for the work force we have secured equally binding assurances that Vector Aerospace will remain at the current locations as long as it is economically viable to do so The MOD has also secured a legally binding commitment that Vector Aerospace cannot sell or transfer the business to a third party without the MOD s prior approval If the sale proceeds we expect Vector Aerospace not only to maintain current capability but to innovate and to improve the current service that DARA provides Vector Aerospace has a good track record in both employee relations and improving performance I can also confirm that it has no current plans for redundancies at either site The hon Member for Perth and North Perthshire Pete Wishart has accused the Government of lacking imagination and he has asked that we think again about the sale I do not know to what degree he has looked at the developments that have taken place under the defence industrial strategy I am not at all sure what priority he gives to the issue because I am not certain what priority his party gives to defence per se never mind to the industrial hinterland that is required if we are to maintain our defence capabilities All the innovation that the hon Gentleman talked about and the methodologies for bringing well paid employment and high levels of performance to the defence industries is already taking place through partnering arrangements There are such arrangements for different aspects of manufacture for fleet maintenance my hon Friend the Member for Portsmouth North Sarah McCarthy Fry will be more aware of that than anyone else in the Chamber and for fixed wing and rotary If we are to develop maintain and ensure security for the work force that has to be the road forward That is the direction that all contracting is taking Inevitably it must go in that direction I know that Members of Parliament have a job to do and my hon Friend the Member for Ochil and South Perthshire has been doing that job for some time However I hope that they will not deliberately posture and scare people because in the end it may be not the sale but ongoing uncertainty about the future that drives the work force away from DARA They need to know that they are appreciated I think that the main reason why the company is interested is the work force s skills It is not the real estate that the company wants it wants that skilled work force so that it can develop them and take them forward If my right hon and hon Friends in the ministerial team and I did not believe that we would not be considering the option as a way forward

I have just said that spending will go up in every year of the Parliament Let me point out to the right hon Gentleman that these are small real terms increases albeit ones that he bitterly opposed That is why given the uncertainties around GDP deflators Andrew Dilnot s letter says in the sentence that the right hon Gentleman did not want to read out that it might also be fair to say real terms expenditure has changed little over this period There it is exposed for all to see a bogus Labour motion trying to paint a picture of cuts to the NHS budget when even the head of the UK Statistics Authority says that the broad picture of NHS spending is that it has been protected in real terms something that almost certainly would not have happened had Labour been in power

As a member of the Welsh Affairs Committee which has taken a considerable amount of evidence on this subject I feel that I can talk about the potential confusion that surrounds the combination of polls that we face The House may be interested in the testimony of Philip Johnson the chair of the Welsh branch of the Association of Electoral Administrators He said The capacity for confusion is immense He said that 2015 when there will be the combination of polls could be horrendous He is not talking about voter confusion over policy issues which will I think be a significant problem for our democracy In Wales where we have a Labour Government various proposals will be made to carry on revive and enliven the policies in Wales Alongside that Labour will put forward a different set of proposals on focus and investment to take to the UK Parliament Therefore there will be quite different proposals from the same party for different elections on the same day What is more there may be varying views on alternative voting Furthermore we will have different constituencies for the Assembly and for the UK parliamentary election For example I might be standing as the candidate for Swansea West and at the same time voters could be asked to vote Labour for the Assembly Member for Swansea Central Obviously that could be confusing to voters We could have one party making different proposals in the same area

I am aware of the case to which my hon Friend referred Mr Evans had a spirometry test in October 1999 in December 2000 the test was declared invalid and he was given the option of being re tested He declined the offer and as a result went on to apply for the full second phase test the MAP test I am given to understand by IRISC the Government s claim handlers that it wrote to Mr Evans s solicitors in July asking for a claims pack to be completed and is still awaiting its return I shall do anything I can to help my hon Friend speed up that claim The monitoring group is fully aware of the problems that have been causing difficulties with the operation of the Wrexham testing centre but we are satisfied that everything is being done to provide the necessary respiratory consultants to carry out all the tests required If he wishes I shall look into the case further I believe that my hon Friend the Minister for Industry and Energy will also reply to him directly

We have those contacts Some of course are in the European Union Some are in NATO Others such as Russia are in partnership with NATO through partnership for peace or the NATO Russian Permanent Joint Council As well as having those military links we try as far as is possible practical and sensible to maintain an interchange and co operation on intelligence matters There is a reason for that As I said yesterday the terrorist threat faces us all It is not a clash of civilisations but a clash of evil terrorists against civilisation Whatever differences we have with most of the great powers of the world they are overcome by the common threat that we face and the common awareness that we must face it together We certainly do that

Clearly Ukraine needs to pay its bills as well as paying its pensioners and funding its Government to ensure I know that the hon Member for Bolsover Mr Skinner misses the old days of the Soviet Union but perhaps he will stop speaking from a sedentary position for five minutes It is important that Ukraine pays its bills and an IMF programme and IMF action can help that to happen

I have a lot of sympathy for that argument and that is why we have to cut more slack for these developing countries I am going to come on to talk about coal but in November the Secretary of State in this country said that we were going to phase out coal by 2025 The following week Germany commissioned a brand new lignite burning power station That sort of behaviour plays to the point just made by the hon Member from the Scottish nationalists that it is very hard to lecture the Indians and the Chinese on coal when there are countries in Europe this year commissioning brand new coal power stations We have talked about how important Paris is The hon Member for Swansea West Geraint Davies made the point that we may well be close to 1 5 anyway it is a statistical model and it is quite hard to tell However the fact is that the INDC that the EU including the UK put into the Paris commitment is approximately half as onerous in terms of decarbonisation as that which the Climate Change Act 2008 requires us to do in the UK We will reduce our emissions by the fifth carbon budget by 57 in 2030 The EU offering was a 40 reduction which includes the UK s 57 We are seeing the result of this already Last year carbon emissions across the EU as a whole increased by 0 7 I accept that that was only one year and that this is not something to be looked at one year at a time but 18 of the 28 countries in the EU either had no decrease in emissions or an increase For completeness in that same time the UK reduced its emissions by around 3 Those statistics are from Eurostat I want to talk more widely about why it is that the EU has lost its way on climate policy There is a fixation on coal in the EU Germany is often regarded as being a leader on renewables and it is Germany has far more renewables than we have However it also has much higher carbon emissions than we do The reason for that is the coal that it has Germany has four times as much coal as the UK and it is not four times more populous There are parallels in other countries Does it matter Perhaps not in one sense someone has to lead and it is us However the DECC website shows that electricity prices in the UK for domestic consumers are something like 50 above the EU mean our gas prices are not and our industrial prices are about 80 higher Why does that matter I come from a constituency in the north of England where we still try to manufacture things It is very hard to talk about rebalancing the economy and the northern powerhouse on the back of differentially high energy prices I do not think that the EU has taken the position that it has on purpose So why is it that the policy objectives of reducing carbon have not been realised The first error that was made this is true of a lot of directives is that there was confusion as to the target A lot of the early EU directives were about renewables and not decarbonisation which is a secondary target The consequence is that CCS which we have talked about was not emphasised gas as a transition fuel was not emphasised and nuclear was not emphasised the biggest omission of all Of all EU electricity 30 comes from nuclear The fact that for many countries in the EU that is not even regarded as part of the solution is quite bizarre Two or three hon Members this afternoon talked about CCS and I regret that the UK is not pushing ahead with that However it really beggars belief to say that that is a European issue when a number of countries in the EU including Germany have banned CCS It is not a question of not developing it they have banned it The other error that the EU has made is to create a general parity between different types of fossil fuels Coal and gas are very different indeed in terms of their materiality on this One reason why the UK does a lot better than the EU is the amount of gas that we use and the fact that we have displaced coal with gas I like to quote this statistic if the world were to replace all the coal that we currently burn with gas that would be equivalent to five times or a factor of 500 more renewables To pretend that that is not part of the solution is just plain wrong One reason that people regard it as not being part of the solution is that the pathway has been mistaken for the objective Yes at some point we need to get to an emissions level below that which is afforded by gas but the truth is that emissions are cumulative The hon Member for Swansea West Geraint Davies said that we may well be close to the 1 5 in terms of particulates and all that goes with them That is true and it is a cumulative effect Carbon does not go out of the atmosphere for a very long time It is not just about pathway For that reason gas should have been far more of a factor in this than it has been

With the setback of four ministerial resignations and March 2019 bearing down upon us will the Prime Minister think again about the extension of article 50 It would enable her to hold a vote on the final deal which I know she is not in favour of and give her additional time in the negotiations with the EU to secure a better deal than the one she might be about to secure

My understanding is that at the moment Kinnegar is mostly used as a storage facility and the number of civilians employed there is relatively small However I cannot guarantee this is part of another statement in a sense that as that role decreases there will not be some changes in the civilian staffing level However if the hon Gentleman would like me to write to him with further details of the overall position affecting Kinnegar I will be happy to do so

In a speech I made public what we would do We would be out and this time I hope that the hon Gentleman s party would follow us and take immediate action I was about to develop that point in my speech When we were called in by the former Secretary of State and asked whether we would put our representatives on the policing board I said XWe could consider that provided you aren t going to make a deal afterwards with IRA Sinn Fein and bring them in by the back door He said to us XIf you don t join the policing board now it was the last day on which we could join Xyou will not be on it until there is an election I said XThank you but answer this question If the IRA don t join it will it have to wait for an election before it gets on the board He said XThat is right However that is not what is being negotiated now We were brought in under false pretences We were given a promise on which the IRA has not delivered and is not going to deliver I say unequivocally that it will drive real Unionists out of the policing board Perhaps that is what it wants to do

First may I associate myself with the words of the shadow Chancellor and the Chancellor on the late Jo Cox May I also thank the Chancellor for what he said about the Tay cities deal I note that what he said was slightly different from the words in the Red Book so we will take him at face value from the Dispatch Box In his attempt to clamp down on evasion it was disappointing that no reference was made to Scottish limited partnerships One would have thought that there would have been more too in terms of fairness overall and a reference to the Women Against State Pension Inequality campaign and the unfairness for those women The Chancellor gave us plenty of information today but with no more than a glib reference to being match fit at the beginning and a bit of deflection there was very little on the elephant in the room which is Brexit It is not as if the Treasury does not know what the consequences of it will be its own assessment tells us that tax yields could be down by 66 billion a year after 15 years and GDP down perhaps by 9 5 a figure confirmed by the London School of Economics as a result of reduced trade lowering productivity That amounts to some 6 500 per year per household So where was the plan to ensure that there is no hard Brexit and to maintain access to the single market Where was the plan to mitigate the losses in tax yield and GDP Although the Chancellor said a considerable amount about capital investment and research and development and I welcome some of it up to a point where was the fully developed scheme actually to boost productivity We do not go into this next period from a position of strength As the Chancellor knows UK GDP is already nearly 20 lower than it would have been had we achieved even a 2 trend growth rate since 2008 Our argument is that the austerity of this Government and the previous Government sucked consumption out of the economy weakening recovery This Government are set to repeat the error Growth barely reaches 2 for the forecast period and although the Chancellor sensibly did not put a date on it he is still targeting a surplus in the economy perhaps again before recovery has been secured I am glad the Chancellor has changed the fiscal charter because the previous permanent surplus rule taking 10 billion a year more out than required to run a balanced economy and cutting 50 billion a year more than required to run a balanced current budget left us with some terrible consequences As discretionary consolidation cuts and tax rises took place the ratio of cuts to tax rises also increased placing the burden of austerity and an arbitrary fiscal target on the back of the poor That has made the poorest decile 5 worse off and the richest 10 almost entirely better off The Government have clearly worked out something and I welcome the move on the taper but let us be clear at 2p in the pound on the minimum wage that is 14p an hour It is not a king s ransom and it will not cure poverty The squeeze has not been lifted from the poor and the screw of the welfare cap has not been turned off this has simply made a brutal regime slightly less brutal I am glad that the Chancellor mentioned the actions of the Bank of England Our party very much welcomes what the Governor has done He has introduced an increase in quantitative easing and 60 billion of extra Government bond purchases made 10 billion available for corporate bond purchases set a 0 25 base rate and enabled additional term funding to encourage more and cheaper long term lending from the banks However there has been a more or less complete absence of a fiscal policy stimulus to match the incredible monetary policy activism of the central bank The key part of today s autumn statement I am pleased to hear that this is the last one it is my 25th Budget autumn statement or pre Budget statement was the increase in total managed expenditure but like for like it amounts to 1 5 of total managed expenditure over the forecast period from 2015 16 to 2020 21 It is to be welcomed and it certainly represents a break from the recent past but it can in no way be described as the sort of fiscal stimulus required to match the monetary policy discipline of the central bank The Chancellor talked about an increase in capital investment which I very much welcome He also talked about an increase in funding for research and development However given the fact that the description of research and development has changed in the Green Book as has the description of the UK Trade Investment funding he said that there would be a doubling of some aspects of export support it is hard to tell precisely what the impact of some of those measures will be Will he tell us what the total increase in cash and percentage terms of this vital export support will be Will he also tell us what the overall increase in research and development funding will be across the piece How does he intend to deploy the 23 billion of what he described as capital investment

My hon Friend raised some important issues in the debate which as he was kind enough to acknowledge I have been addressing as has the regulator Ofcom which of course is accountable to the House rather than to Ministers ICSTIS and others involved as well as the companies I felt that this was such an important issue on which to provide enlightenment that I wrote to all Members of the House on 7 November on several of the telecoms issues that were raising concerns to explain the actions that were being taken by all involved Some of the issues raised by my hon Friend are for commercial organisations to deal with whereas others are issues that we have already addressed either directly or through the regulatory bodies as he was kind enough to acknowledge at the start of his remarks He was offered an opportunity to clarify his specific concerns which he has every right not to do but it is important in responding to the debate to set the proper context Let us be clear when such an event occurs the blame lies on the author of the scam or crime Measures that have been put in place such as withholding money for 30 days to allow recompense or fines to bite are an important means of protection for the future and of making sure that those who contemplate such activity cannot get away with it As my hon Friend acknowledged service providers have also been victims Generosity in dealing with victims is desirable when the service provider is a large company as he indicated but it is not enforceable we cannot require that of a company that is itself a victim when the problem has arisen because of the ability to use computer equipment that is no part of the provision of BT or any other service provider We must be even handed Our duty is to make sure that there is effective and fair regulation and I am pleased by the steps taken to address that ICSTIS is consulting on changing the way in which its code deals with refunds Early next year it should be possible to get refunds from those telecoms companies that terminate premium rate services which is an important part of the issue I would be the first to acknowledge that this is a complicated area of commercial activity in which the fast changing nature of information and communication technologies and the pace of convergence between technologies offer a number of challenges It should also be acknowledged however that it is a success story in terms of both the services now available and the way in which industry is co operating with Government to deal with the cowboys In the case of a number of scams we have effectively created an antisocial behaviour order for the bad guys without tying the good guys up in red tape To those who think that internet activity and premium rate services are wholly bad I say Look at the facts and study the reality Just banning it all as a colleague said to me last week would be so disproportionate as to give the Luddites a good name I know that that is not what my hon Friend has asked for

I congratulate my hon Friend on the work he is doing to encourage councils to do more to tackle the blight caused by derelict and empty buildings in town centres such as Wisbech in his constituency As I said we have published the best practice guidance relating to section 215 notices and we will certainly do more if we can to encourage councils to use those powers I will also look at his suggestion

I apologise to my hon Friend the Member for Hexham Guy Opperman for being unable to get to the earlier part of the debate because of a meeting The hon Lady will know that in the remote rural parts of Northumberland such as my constituency the air ambulance is vital because without it it would be extremely difficult to get cases to hospitals which are often closer to her constituency in Newcastle where they need to be treated

The hon Gentleman is speaking very persuasively as he always does about this matter Does he agree that there is a role for charities to support the NHS and that Combat Stress in particular offers an extremely impressive level of care that we cannot expect the NHS to match because of the specialism required to deal with military personnel suffering from mental health issues

I will make a little more progress and then I will gladly give way again The Government would cover the costs to employers of paying national minimum wage and national insurance for a 25 hour week plus 500 per employee to help businesses with training admin and set up costs In return employers would be expected to provide training and development for those taking part and show how the jobs were additional not replacing existing jobs and not leading to somebody else losing their job or seeing a reduction in hours

My hon Friend indicates from a sedentary position that the Government can revoke the knighthood In that case I am sure that Members of the House who have spoken in the debate who know a lot about Zimbabwe will call on the Government to do that with great haste Another window of opportunity is coming up with the Kampala Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting It is essential that Zimbabwe be on the agenda The President of Zimbabwe might have taken his country out of the Commonwealth but the people of Zimbabwe remain in the Commonwealth We should use the opportunity of Kampala to advance their cause and make it clear to other African leaders who are critical in private that they need to be critical in public to make the change that is sorely needed

I made it clear at the outset of my speech that we will not oppose the Bill on Second Reading We welcome a number of the Bill s measures but the Government should go further I hope that the Secretary of State will agree that reform should not come at the expense of access to justice and if Lord Thomas whom we all hold in high esteem is saying that our system of justice has become unaffordable to most both sides of the House must take that seriously Nothing more poignantly demonstrates what Lord Thomas said about the barriers to access to justice than the 70 reduction in employment tribunal cases following the coalition Government s introduction of employment tribunal fees The Bill must provide answers to such problems Technology alone is not a panacea nor must it be utilised to mask further cuts to public funding A key feature of the Bill that has received much coverage in recent weeks is the proposed reform of whiplash claims When the Bill was published many people were pleased that it did not raise the small claims limit for all personal injuries so the Government can be congratulated on listening or listening a little but we should be clear that the reform of whiplash claims is based on a false premise The Secretary of State said today that there is a rampant compensation culture but there is no epidemic of fraudulent claims The British people are not on the fiddle or on the make in the way that the Government so disparagingly suggest

I agree with my hon Friend I mean with the hon Member for Taunton Mr Browne although he has been present in this debate for so long that he is becoming a friend to those of us on the Conservative Benches The hon Gentleman is right how will the Government implement that proposal other than by using clipboards and intruding unnecessarily into every family business I welcome the decision by the Chancellor to delay the proposals by a year but it would be far better if common sense prevailed and they were dropped altogether The perceived abuse is smaller than Ministers have been told and as the hon Member for Taunton suggested the costs of trying to resolve the problem economically and if I may say so to the Chief Secretary politically will prove far greater than the benefits the Government seek Rather than creating a vicious circle by creating new laws and then trying to clamp down on the changes that are made as a result Ministers should make our tax laws simple clear and constant By doing that they would tackle the root of the problem they would remove the desire and the opportunity to evade one s obligations A simpler and fairer tax system is what the UK needs and I am pleased to say that that is what my party is proposing Last Wednesday the Chancellor announced not just the Budget but as we heard from the Secretary of State earlier the Government s latest enterprise White Paper Like his predecessor the Chancellor talked glowingly about the importance of small businesses and highlighted a number of policies that he obviously hopes will begin to restore their confidence in him Well if I were him I would not hold my breath After the last year small businesses have lost whatever faith they may have had in the Government First came the increase in small company corporation tax then rising business rates then an extra 10 billion in new regulatory costs and finally the 900 million capital gains tax bombshell The result of all that is that from April in just a few weeks the tax bills of small businesses will rise by 1 000 million per annum and from April 2009 they will rise by 1 500 million per annum Given the economic downturn why increase tax bills for 99 per cent of businesses Given that small businesses employ more than 10 million people why make their finances worse just when the economy needs all the help it can get As I said the Budget was accompanied by a White Paper on enterprise Ministers describe it as a strategy but in fact it is the usual new Labour hotch potch of warm words photo opportunities and good intentions To be fair there are some good points in it on procurement and invoice finance for example I am pleased that the Government finally accept that some small businesses should be exempted from some regulations For the past seven years since I have been a Member Ministers have fought tooth and nail against that principle but now that they have accepted it we shall see whether they mean what they say On female entrepreneurship we heard from the Secretary of State earlier that it is important to increase the proportion of women who start and run their own firms I entirely agree It is a sad truth that British women are only half as likely to run their own firm as their counterparts in America However we have heard that language from Ministers before In the 2005 Budget the Prime Minister who was then the Chancellor announced a new women s enterprise task force We were told that it would turn things round in three years and make demonstrable progress yet 11 months after the announcement Ministers had not even appointed a chairwoman to run it With less than 12 months left to undertake the earlier initiative we have another announcement and another initiative The truth is that such Whitehall led top down initiatives rarely work and those that show promise are never given the long term commitment needed to make a real difference In his opening remarks the Secretary of State for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform proudly pointed to the rise in the number of small companies as a sign that our entrepreneurial culture is increasing However what he did not say is that the increase has been slower than the growth in our population The start up rate has actually fallen from 3 2 per 1 000 people in 1997 to only three per 1 000 last year The other critical measure of that activity total entrepreneurial activity has also dropped from 7 7 per cent in 2001 to 5 8 per cent in 2006 Despite what the Secretary of State claims and I suspect hopes the culture of entrepreneurship is reaching a smaller and smaller proportion of the country it is a culture that is shrinking not spreading Similarly small firms are growing more slowly All the leading independent statistics show that the proportion of small firms achieving turnover at the critical figure of 1 million after five years has fallen from 48 per cent in 1997 to only 16 per cent in 2006 In fact in the UK it now takes an average of 14 years for a company to reach a 5 million turnover Of equal concern is the fact that fewer small businesses employ people than 10 years ago The most recent statistics show that the figure has fallen to only 28 per cent of SMEs In other words after 10 years of Labour Government seven in 10 small firms no longer employ people When Ministers produce whatever their next set of employment regulations may be they might just want to reflect carefully on why fewer businesses want to employ people The Chancellor and other Ministers talk about promoting small businesses but their policies are holding them back While DBERR the Department for business is publishing its enterprise White Paper the Treasury is simultaneously raising small firms bills by 1 billion The sad conclusion which I hear all the time from the business community is that DBERR Ministers business Ministers are increasingly irrelevant Last year when asked about corporation tax rises the Secretary of State for business merely referred people to the Treasury He said that he had nothing to say When the Chancellor announced the capital gains tax rise he did not even consult the Secretary of State for business What use is a Secretary of State for business and enterprise who is completely overlooked by the Treasury when business taxes rise Over the coming months our economy faces a stern test but I am sorry to say that it is one for which the Government have left us ill prepared I want business to prosper and entrepreneurs to thrive but I fear that with the current incumbents in Downing street at No 10 and No 11 British business and British entrepreneurs will have to compete with one hand tied firmly behind their back

My understanding is that that provision is fairly well understood to do business is a wider phrase than to enter into contracts The contracts provision follows the OECD model of tax conventions on permanent establishment in a given jurisdiction and it therefore tracks better the language of international tax law

Indeed Has not the Chancellor given a tax cut to second home owners of a minimum of 6 per cent and in certain circumstances of 30 per cent Has he considered the impact of those measures on rural areas such as Cornwall mid Wales the Lake district and large parts of rural England where local people are being priced out of the housing market by second home owners Is the implication of the Chancellor s retreat today and his move away from taper relief that he accepts that the changes brought in at the outset of the Labour Government when I believe he was Chief Secretary to the Treasury were as indeed some of us argued at the time expensive unnecessary and a diversion Will he tell us what was wrong with the capital gains tax system under the previous Conservative Government which was introduced by Lord Lawson That system had at its heart a very simple central principle that income and capital should be taxed on the same basis If as the Chancellor is arguing and as the Conservatives now appear to want income is taxed at a significantly higher rate than capital there is a massive opportunity for tax avoidance as individuals and companies convert income into capital What estimate has the Treasury made of the potential leakage into tax avoidance from that very familiar route Finally and on that basis may I commend the idea of going back to the 1997 capital gains tax system which was simple made generous provision for small business had indexation and would on the Treasury s own estimates produce an additional tax revenue of about 2 7 billion That could be used now for cutting the taxes of cleaners and other people on low pay

At the end of this Parliament and before returning I trust to the same side of this Chamber in late May I am pleased to update the House on NHS work force numbers On the back of a strong economy our NHS now has more doctors nurses and midwives than ever before in its history including 7 500 more nurses and 9 500 more doctors The result is 9 million more operations during this Parliament than the previous Parliament fewer people waiting a long time for their operations and a start in putting right the scandal of short staffed wards that we inherited and were highlighted by the Francis report Indeed last year the Commonwealth Fund said that under this Government the NHS has become the safest most patient centred and overall best health care system in any major country

I am grateful for this opportunity to raise some of the serious concerns that have been caused by this Government s refusal to fully fund our NHS The Government are running out of places to cut corners to save money on the NHS They are showing a lack of respect and compassion as they fail to provide the healthcare that people need and deserve Those who need care at home are having to make do with 15 minute flying visits We have seen the pressure in A E departments building over the past six years and yet every year we reach a winter crisis that is somehow a surprise to the Government We have seen an increase in A E waiting times with more than 1 8 million people waiting more than four hours in 2015 16 an increase of over 400 since 2010 Bed blocking is increasing as our underfunded social care services struggle to deal with demand We have seen an increase in the number of patients waiting on trolleys to be treated or admitted and an increase in the number of hospitals running out of beds We are also about to see a 12 cut to community pharmacies which will lead to the closure or reduction in services of our local pharmacies The time it takes to get a GP appointment is also increasing This is not the most complex of problems If we want a proper functioning full person centred care system that works with compassion and treats those in need professionally and efficiently this Government must fund it

The tax system works on an individual basis and this proposal introduces incredible complexity to the tax system I shall cover that in more detail and explain the cost implications Government Members obviously think that the costs are worth it but I would be very careful about the concept that all married couples will happily share all their money and any tax gain although admittedly we are talking about 3 85 a week That seems to be rolling the clock back somewhat and assuming a level of communication within households that I do not think it is the Government s place to assume Women are more than 26 a week a week worse off in real terms since 2010 and after significant progress under Labour when the gender pay gap fell by more than 7 it is now rising again for the first time in five years The gap between women s median weekly earnings in the private sector and the public sector has increased between 2009 10 and 2012 13 from 28 to 31 The same gap for men has decreased from 17 to 14 At the same time the cost of child care places which we debated at length yesterday has risen by an average of 30 on this Government s watch five times faster than pay Analysis by the House of Commons Library shows that the Chancellor s tax and benefits strategy since 2010 has raised a net 3 047 billion or 21 from men and 79 or just under 12 billion from women That includes the Budget 2010 tax credit cuts which took 2 7 billion from women and only 750 million from men the 2010 spending review under which reductions in child care support through tax credits took 343 million from women but just 47 million from men and the three year child benefit freeze which has taken 1 26 billion from women and 26 million from men That of course contrasts with the 3 billion tax cut that was given to the top 1 of earners in this country under which 85 of the gainers are men and this marriage tax allowance under which 84 of the gainers will be men This issue goes to the heart of the clause and of why we are tabling our amendment

I absolutely share my hon Friend s concern It is incredibly important that families can visit their very young children when they are in unfamiliar surroundings The more units that close especially if we lose the Park the longer the distances that families will have to travel and the more time that they will have to spend apart which will have a further devastating impact It is said that low bed occupancy at the Park illustrates the point that fewer children are being admitted to hospital as part of clinical practice However I submit that low occupancy rates are a symptom not of a clinical decision but of contractual complexity It is well known that many specialist services across the country would like to make use of the Park and Oxford s facilities but as I understand it the trust has not pursued those case by case contracts The dilemma faced by the Park is a clear example of how local commissioning falls down The Park is a national as well as a local service yet it is suffering the severe side effects of the local financial crisis that affects Oxfordshire s health services across the board For example Oxfordshire s supporting people budget which helps adults with learning difficulties lead independent lives has been severely cut The mental health trust faces cuts of 1 million this year and a further 5 million over the next five years Nursing and psychiatric posts are being cut The Barnes unit at the John Radcliffe hospital which provides psychiatric services to those admitted to the accident and emergency department after a suicide attempt or self harm is also under threat of closure Day services are being closed including the Ridgeway day centre at Didcot in my constituency Local financial pressures are leading to the potential closure of a national specialist service I have been in correspondence with the Department of Health about mental health and local health issues since July last year they were some of the first issues that crossed my desk after I was elected and I have been greeted throughout by the Department s mantra It is for PCTs with the support of the Strategic Health Authority if required to plan and develop services in line with national priorities and in context of local need within the financial resources available to them With the best will in the world It being Six o clock the motion for the Adjournment of the House lapsed without Question put Motion made and Question proposed That this House do now adjourn

The former Minister shakes his head but these are the Government s own figures If we look at spending across Europe as a percentage of GDP we see that we are below the EU average when it comes to social security spending just as we are on health spending Let us start with rising costs Traditionally the link between social security and inflation has ensured that some of the most vulnerable households in our country are not made worse off year on year by inflation in the cost of basic goods and services The adequacy of social security has been heavily eroded over the past seven years Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation demonstrates that the price of essentials has risen three times faster than wages over the past 10 years When that is combined with the coalition s initial 1 freeze on uprating introduced in the Welfare Reform Act 2012 and the complete social security freeze put in place in last year s Act it means that low income households have seen a significant deterioration in the adequacy of social security support since 2010 Clearly the historic drop in oil prices and subsequent slow down in inflation of the price of household goods provided some respite to low income households but we know that the impact of the EU referendum on for example food and fuel prices is only just starting People on low incomes spend a much larger proportion of their household budgets on the essential goods and services that have been so prone to inflation so they are likely to have felt the effects of spiralling prices long after they have slowed down The costs of basic household items are beginning to rise again with last month s official figures showing inflation at a two year high of 1 8 I understand that the actual increase in food prices has been approximately 20 but that has only just started to be passed on to consumers so it is going to get worse That puts real pressure on households that are trying to provide for their basic needs Indeed last week the Joseph Rowntree Foundation published a report showing that 19 million people are now struggling to make ends meet and get the basics required for a socially acceptable standard of living In the context I have set out a 1 uprating to some social security entitlements is unlikely to do much for those who are struggling to get by If the Prime Minister is really serious about helping those people I urge that there be some reconsideration As a matter of principle it seems only fair that social security should rise in line with inflation and should apply to all entitlements not just the ones that the Government have cherry picked Although the economic arguments for a freeze may once have been founded on the slow down in the prices of the basics that every household needs now that prices are predicted to rise by 10 by 2020 even that weak economic justification no longer stands up That is before we even get to the social argument for protecting the incomes of the poorest people in our society whom this Government have set out to punish over the past seven years In last year s inquiry by the all party group on health into the effect of the Welfare Reform and Work Act 2016 on child poverty and child health the freeze on social security support payments was singled out as the most damaging I remind Members that the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimates that child poverty will increase by around 1 million as a direct result of social security and tax changes and that will impact on those children s health and futures I make an impassioned plea to the Government and the Minister we are approaching April when several other disability benefits will be cut I urge the Government to reconsider I shall not detain the House any longer I urge the Government to review the cap before price inflation begins to pick up again If they really cared about those struggling to make ends meet that is exactly what they would do In the meantime although we regret the limit on the groups who will benefit from the uprating we will support the order

No sadly much as I would like to give way to my hon Friend who earlier made a very useful intervention on the Prime Minister on this very point time is short As the House will be aware I have had some interest in Northern Ireland both as Tom King s Parliamentary Private Secretary when he was Secretary of State there in the 1980s and in the last Parliament as the shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland I therefore have some recollection of how Mr Tom Kelly arrived on the scene and it was a bad sad occasion The then Secretary of State Mo Mowlam in collusion with Alastair Campbell removed an excellent civil servant Andy Wood He had been a distinguished chief press officer in that Department for a long time and he was hugely well regarded You will recall Mr Deputy Speaker that there was a purge of civil servants in the press departments of different Departments with certain Secretaries of State more willing than others to dance to Mr Campbell s tune and so from the BBC came Mr Tom Kelly

This is not a laughing matter and it is not up to the French when those children have connections with the United Kingdom That is my point In the Grande Synthe camp I met a 16 year old girl who was working hard for exams in a pop up school in a tent She had made the journey to northern France on her own Her father is in the United Kingdom but owing to the absence of guidance from the French authorities and the failure of our Government to act she was stuck in limbo and uncertain about her future Children like her are very vulnerable in the camps It is time for the Home Secretary to show leadership Will she give us a commitment that her Department will ensure that those with a legal right to join their families in the United Kingdom are granted that right as a matter of urgency

It might not have been entirely inappropriate for the hon Lady to intervene because as I recall from my visit to Corby as a young man most of it was populated by Scots and Welsh people who were there to set up the steelworks at the time On the date and the combination of polls however is it not also an own goal on behalf of the Government and particularly the Deputy Prime Minister He is demotivating those electoral reformers among us who would have been prepared to go out alongside colleagues from other political parties to campaign for the alternative vote We will now campaign with our parties to help our Welsh Assembly colleagues get elected and not devote the energy that we otherwise would have done to the Deputy Prime Minister s cause

I speak as a former Member of the European Parliament There are two reasons why the electorate feel so disengaged from the European Union The first is that despite the answer to a question in the Bundestag revealing that 70 per cent of our legislation is now being formed in Europe we would be hard pressed to find any coverage of that formation process in the British press The second is the fact that when we discuss European legislation in this House we do so after the horse has bolted Perhaps we should be more proactive and discuss European legislation at its formative stage when the Commission brings forward the proposals rather than when everything has been done and dusted in the Council and it is too late to make any real changes

It is a pleasure to follow the many fantastic and powerful speeches that we have had today When I have spoken before in this place about domestic abuse I have talked about the fact that it can happen to anybody Over the last year a number of people have come forward with very similar stories including that they have subsequently found out that the person involved was a repeat offender and they were perhaps the second third fourth or fifth individual that that person had got to abused and then discarded There are some really important measures in the Bill I will not go through them all for reasons of time We have been working for a long time with organisations such as Women s Aid on cross examination in the family courts Although this does not particularly need legislation I would also like more awareness in the family courts of cluster B personality disorders such as narcissistic personality disorder so that people hearing the evidence are not taken in by a perpetrator s superficial charm We have talked about economic abuse I commend the work of organisations such as Lloyds bank which is offering extra support to people it discovers are experiencing financial economic and domestic abuse It is so important that we educate others including GPs We heard from the former Secretary of State for International Trade my right hon Friend for

This is an important issue and obviously my hon Friend with her particular experience is well aware of it in a sense that many of us will not be I thank her first for the work that she undertakes as the co chair of the APPG on children who need palliative care Of course I am sure that the thoughts of the whole House are with those parents who find themselves in this situation We have made a commitment to everyone at the end of life including children setting out the actions we are taking to make high quality and personalisation a reality for all and to end the variation in end of life care This covers a whole range of aspects including practical and emotional support because that is an important aspect of good end of life care That is set out of course in our end of life commitment and our ambitions for palliative care framework But it can be difficult for some commissioners to develop suitable care models for children That is why I understand NHS England is convening an expert group to develop commissioning models that are suitable for this particularly vulnerable group of patients and ensure they get the support and care they need

No it is a full day s debate in Government time on the UK s exit from the European Union and workers rights and it is but the first of a series of such debates that will provide ample opportunity for Members of Parliament from all parties to express their views clearly I will just say this to the hon Lady if she really thinks that it is sensible for the Government to set out in public a detailed negotiating position ahead of a negotiation with 20 other countries I would love to be negotiating on the other side of the table from her

In preparing for this debate especially in relation to tuition fees I tried to heed the advice of H L Mencken on dealing with political opponents which is always to assume that they are just as honest and decent as oneself and that they sometimes may even be right However I must confess that on this particular issue I have struggled to give the Government the benefit of the doubt and I have failed so far in trying to do so The strapline on the higher education Bill in the parliamentary Labour party s information was free at the point of use and fair at the point of repayment I hope that the Secretary of State can confirm that there is no read across from education to health To me that statement sounds like a retreat from the principle of universal and comprehensive access to public services I accept the Government s argument that they are sincere about the proposals that they are making and that they want to widen participation and access but I hope that they will also reflect on the sincerity of hon Members on both sides of the House who fear that the changes could make a bad situation worse in terms of the inequality of opportunity that currently pertains in our higher education system In fact those inequalities could be reinforced between institutions between different parts of the UK and between students themselves It is very interesting and instructive to reflect on the fact that the person who first came up with the idea of income contingent repayment that is paying not out of current income but out of future income as in deferred tuition fees was none other than Milton Friedman He came up with the idea of deferred tuition fees in a paper published in 1955 The argument that he used is the very same one that is being used now Indeed he returned to the theme in Free to Choose Who can forget that piece of Thatcherite propaganda In that book he said of higher education In this area those of us who are middle and upper income classes have conned the poor into subsidising us on a grand scale That was Milton Friedman s argument but it is now being replayed by the Government Perhaps that is no surprise

Exactly as I described them last time I spoke to the House after I gave evidence to the Baker Hamilton inquiry They fit into two categories First inside Iraq it is important that we complete the building up of capability especially that of the Iraqi army For example down in the south the Iraqi army is now capable of taking on security in two out of the four provinces and it is increasingly doing so in Basra We have to complete that process We must also ensure that the governance and capability of the Iraqi Government are improved That relates not only to the way in which the Government function but to the disbursement of money in both Sunni and Shi a areas It is important that we make sure that the process of reconciliation that the Iraqi Prime Minister has outlined is carried through with greater effect than has been the case so far Secondly outside Iraq as I said to the inquiry and as I have said to the House on many occasions we have to pursue a policy for the whole middle east which means in particular and starting with finding a solution to the Israel Palestine conflict That will be absolutely essential if we are to put that region on a more stable footing

I agree with my hon Friend that it is important that the public sector supports the construction industry if public money were not going into housing and into schools hospitals and other construction projects the industry would be in a far worse position than it is in even now That is why we have brought forward permission for local authorities and other public bodies to spend money That is very important and if councils are not doing that people should ask them why not because we have made it clear that we are prepared to allow spending to be brought forward in all parts of the country We have also made it clear to the devolved Administrations that they too can bring forward their proposals and we look forward to receiving them

That is the case yes I can say from personal experience that the longer a person leaves the problem undiagnosed or untreated the worse it gets I wish to touch on this idea that parents are somehow geniuses and know how to deal with children with mental illness They do not I work with Kinship Carers in Durham which is run by Lyn Boyd a friend of mine It deals with grandparents uncles aunts and others who often find themselves later on in life looking after young people and children Many of them have quite horrifying stories to tell They often end up with the children because of abuse because the parents cannot cope or because they want to save them from the care system I had a case earlier this year in which a six year old was self harming When I looked at his background and talked to his grandparents who were looking after him I could understand why but the issue is how does he access CAMHS They were told that he had to wait six months There we have a couple who are not the biological parents looking after a six year old All they can say is What do we do The child is also disruptive at school That leads to pressure on the school which then seeks to exclude him What happens to the child then We are talking about not just the trauma torment and heartache of a six year old self harming but the knock on effect on the family and the school We do need a new system It may be a community based provision I would certainly like to see open access services they could be run by well funded voluntary sector organisations or by the local authorities and councils where people can go for help or even on occasion just information Those grandparents for example did not have a clue what to do What does a person do in that situation The system is certainly failing those individuals It should not be up to me as a Member of Parliament to contact a mental health trust to enable those people to gain access to services That is where we are failing The problem is not just about ensuring that we have joined up local services I have already said that local authority budget cuts are having a direct impact on the working of such services but the changes in the national health service and GP commissioning which has made things worse for many voluntary organisations Contracts are being let for a whole host of services many of which are too large and too complex The idea that local community groups can bid for such services does not work because those services are just too big which means that those groups are being excluded from the money that is available I am not for one minute saying that anyone who works in the voluntary community sector providing mental health services wants a free ride Those groups are quite happy to be evaluated My hon Friend the Member for West Ham mentioned a project in her constituency that secured lottery funding That project will certainly have had to ensure that the outcomes were there and that it was accountable There is no way that many of those small organisations which in many cases would provide a cheaper and better option for delivering the service can manage those contracts that are currently being let by the NHS The way in which the Government should look at this matter it is perhaps very difficult in this age of austerity is that if they deal with it properly they could save taxpayers money It would saves not just the heartache of the individuals who are going through the system but if done properly money as well On page 9 of the report the chief medical officer said Early intervention services that provide intensive support for young people experiencing a first psychotic episode can help avoid substantial health and social care costs over 10 years perhaps 15 in costs can be avoided for every 1 invested If the Government really want value for money this is a way to do it However there is a problem which is that in this country it is said that we know the cost of everything but the value of nothing The investment now in young people will possibly not pay for itself for another 10 or 20 years but when it does the payback to society will be quite large and not just in terms of our having a healthier and happier society Another area I would like to touch on which is covered in the report is prevention through the work done in schools and by making sure that we mainstream wellbeing The hon Member for East Worthing and Shoreham mentioned the difficulties of Whitehall Government and the silos people are in We have enough reports on some of these areas now and we do not need any more what we need to do now is to hardwire mental wellbeing into all public policy across Whitehall Can it be done Yes it can I was involved when the last Labour Government mainstreamed veterans policy Bob Ainsworth who was the Minister at the time commissioned a report on veterans He made sure that the issue was taken forward and that each Department when it was coming up with public policy took veterans into account We need a similar approach to mental health and mental wellbeing The only way to do that is to have a Cabinet Sub Committee so that this is dealt with at Cabinet level and the main Departments make sure when they are coming up with a policy that they take into account mental health and mental wellbeing As I said early investment saves money but it also makes for a better society Another issue where I totally agree with the report is supporting school counsellors Counsellors could be something of a pressure valve in the system If they are properly trained and there is a proper network of them across schools they could intervene early on and prevent some of these issues The hon Gentleman said he was reluctant to make it mandatory for schools to carry out this work but as the report says we have national standards and curricula for physical education so we should have them for mental health as well Again it is a patchy picture There is some good work going on in schools across the country with teachers taking the initiative In my constituency Simon Westrip a lecturer at Northumbria University has done some work around mindfulness with local community groups and he is now taking that into secondary schools If we look at some of the feedback on and evaluation of mindfulness in schools it is clear that this is not just about the effect on individuals it actually raises standards in many cases However the approach to these issues is patchy and unless they have dedicated time in the curriculum or they are something governing bodies need to take into account people will not do that Done properly such work will not only address the pressures that a lot of our young people face now so that they are happier going through school but it will save lives and in some cases save money in the long term Is this rocket science I am not sure it is We in this country have to change our attitude to mental wellbeing If we get it right in children as the report highlights the payback for this country and its economy in the long term will be tremendous Let me finish where I started by thanking the British Youth Council for its work I also thank it for giving us another opportunity today to talk about mental health on the Floor of the House

I congratulate my hon Friend on the development at Lloyds May I ask him to look further at the form of recapitalisation executed there namely the reduction in high interest rate preference shares for normal equity to see whether or not he could consider in the case of Bradford Bingley and others using high yielding bonds too They could be repaid and therefore make it much easier in terms of bank liquidity to promote the very increase in borrowing that we seek

The hon Gentleman has highlighted one of the key issues that remain to be resolved Whether we talk of unintended consequences or of moral hazards if we write into statute that the agent once appointed cannot be held responsible in any way for what was spent in the past we shall merely create an incentive for no one to appoint an agent until Parliament is prorogued or dissolved before an election That would lead to anarchy Everyone would be spending everything and appointing agents the day before the Prime Minister went to the palace and no one would be accountable for anything We are trying to strike a balance I have been frank about the fact that we have not resolved all the issues which is why it would be unwise at this stage to write anything too prescriptive into the Bill The amendment that we propose to table in another place will be an enabling amendment allowing us to present subsequent orders through the affirmative procedure It will give us time to study the Electoral Commission s proposals examine what happens elsewhere continue the discussion among ourselves and return to our constituencies and prepare for the arrangements by consulting our own agents I have a particularly excellent agent who I am sure will cope with it all admirably None the less we should be aware that we are creating burdens Amendment No 20 deals specifically with unauthorised third party election expenses Following the case of Bowman v UK the Government amended section 75 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 by means of the Political Parties Elections and Referendums Act 2000 to increase the expenditure limit for unauthorised third parties However the relevant section remains ambiguous in relation to precisely what the money can be spent on Clause 29 clears that up Expenditure by unauthorised third parties up to the specified level 500 will be allowed on holding public meetings or organising any public display on issuing advertisements circulars or publications and on other ways of presenting a candidate s views to the electorate The purpose of clause 29 6 which amendment No 20 would delete is to enable the clarification provided by clause 29 to apply to minimise the dangers of erroneous prosecution of a third party who has misunderstood the ambiguous legislation and may therefore have contravened it while acting in good faith Anyone who has been prosecuted which has already happened in one case will now be able to cite subsection 6 in his or her defence or in the event of a repeal We have taken powers in the Bill to ensure that when there is a list election under one of the various proportional representation systems the names of all the candidates will not have to appear at the bottom of the documents on which the imprint is quite large Someone I think it was a Conservative Back Bencher asked about county council and other elections In fact it was the hon Member for Somerton and Frome I apologise for calling him a Conservative Apparently the hon Gentleman will see me outside I spent the new year in his constituency and this is how he repays me A sensible point was made In next year s London election one party will put up 60 candidates Will the names of all 60 have to be listed at the bottom of the leaflets They would take up half the space which would obviously be silly Our amendment No 63 extends the provisions already applying to other types of election to cover the eventuality described by the hon Gentleman

I wish I could find some way of speeding up the police investigation I have wished that several times in the course of the past two or three years But it is a fundamental principle that police investigations in this country are not subject to political control and it is just not possible for a Government Minister to start intervening and questioning or second guessing what the police are doing I am assured that the police are carrying out thorough investigations and I only have estimates of when they might finish That is why we have come to the situation which has dissatisfied some of my colleagues where we really have to get on and inquire into this and the best way of proceeding is to put our new ISC to the test

I thank the Home Secretary for sight of her statement Our long British tradition of policing by consent depends on our maintaining and ensuring the very highest standards of integrity and professionalism in British policing The international reputation of our police is high We know about the bravery and integrity of many officers across the country but we also know that when policing goes wrong it can cast a deep shadow over all that excellent work and undermine consent and confidence too That is why we have called for much stronger action on standards in policing Lord Stevens is leading a major independent commission on the future of policing which recommends radical reform The reforms include a new stronger police standards authority replacing the Independent Police Complaints Commission and the Her Majesty s inspectorate of constabulary with the power to launch investigations without referral and make sure that lessons are learned chartered registration for every police officer the ability to strike officers off the register high professional and ethical standards against which officers must be measured throughout their career public misconduct hearings and a new Police First scheme to bring bright graduates especially from technology backgrounds into policing and many further reforms Today the Home Secretary has announced not strong reforms but a series of reviews three reviews and one consultation Many are welcome as far as they go We welcome stronger action on whistleblowers with greater protection for whistleblowers and transparency for the public We welcome more support for police leadership although she will be aware that when West Yorkshire tried her existing proposals on direct entry none of the dozens of people who applied met the right standards We agree that the complaints procedure and disciplinary system need to be reformed because they are not working but these reviews just do not go far enough Why not get on with it and introduce a proper register of chartered police officers I am glad that she has agreed with our call for public disciplinary hearings but again why not get on with disciplinary reform and hand it over to the College of Policing giving it the power to hold public hearings and to strike people off Why waste time on piecemeal reforms of the IPCC and the complaints procedure when the truth is that they need to be replaced We have repeatedly called on the Home Secretary to replace the IPCC The IPCC is supposed to be able to deal with things that go wrong in policing It is better than the Police Complaints Authority that it replaced but it has failed in its remit because it lacks the powers capacity and credibility it needs It failed on Ian Tomlinson It failed on the Stephen Lawrence case and had to apologise to the family as a result It failed to set out the clear lessons to be learned from a series of death in custody cases including the Camm case in West Yorkshire It has failed to deal with the problems from plebgate and is still failing even to make a decision on whether to investigate what happened at Orgreave more than 12 months after a complaint was raised How many reviews does she need to tell her that this system is not working If she answers only one of my questions today will she explain why she will not just admit that the IPCC is failing and needs to be replaced by a much stronger body The one thing that the Home Secretary is not reviewing that she should be is her flagship policing reform of police and crime commissioners She spent 100 million enough for several thousand constables on elections in November and only 15 of voters turned out Now she is about to spend nearly 4 million of taxpayers money on a by election in the middle of August What will the turnout be then How low will turnouts have to fall before she admits that she got those flagship police reforms wrong The Home Secretary also claimed that her other policing reforms were working but the HMIC has today admitted that neighbourhood policing is now being eroded Prosecutions and convictions are falling for violent crime rape domestic violence and child sex offences even though all those offences are going up There were 7 000 more violent crimes last year but 7 000 fewer people were convicted of violent offences She is failing to reform the police to deal with new and growing crimes There has been too little action on online fraud which is growing exponentially On online child abuse the National Crime Agency has details of more than 10 000 suspects but it has no plans to investigate them all to arrest them or to bar them from working with children because it admits that it does not have the capacity and systems in place to cope In the face of those challenges what are the Home Secretary s police reforms The answer is lots more reviews I am glad that she is moving in the direction that we called for and we are keen to work with her if she will agree now to go much further but so far we have standards that are not high enough enforcement that is not strong enough police and crime commissioners no one wants to vote for fewer police on the beat fewer criminals being caught and less justice for victims The Home Secretary s reviews are too little and too late We will work with her if she goes further We need not just reviews but reforms that work

I thank the Minister for his Department s willingness to meet the town clerk of Totton and Eling town council in my constituency who has been co ordinating efforts to improve procedures for dealing with travellers in our part of Hampshire As I understand it the new powers that will be granted to make removal easier are contingent on the provision of sites for travellers by town councils Will the Minister issue planning guidelines to adjust current restrictions on planning that make it difficult for town and parish councils to supply those sites given normal restrictions on planning procedures otherwise with the best will in the world councils may want to supply the sites but be prevented from doing so by the restrictions on planning

My hon Friend has come to what I think is the most important point the auditing particularly the external auditing of Members claims which provides protection for Members as much as for the public and the public purse Members should look forward to it rather than be afraid of it I say in passing that my hon Friend might be a bit optimistic in thinking that full publication will somehow defuse the public interest in all this The public interest will still be there because some members of the public simply delight in these matters I am nevertheless very much in favour of going ahead with the freedom of information proposals

I hope that you Mr Speaker and the Minister will agree that this is an extremely serious matter and that there are many avenues that the House and its Committees may wish to explore For example do Mr Coulson and his employer the Leader of the Opposition stand by the comments that the former made to the Culture Media and Sport Committee in March 2003 that it is acceptable to make cash payments to police officers for private information Why on earth did the Metropolitan police not properly investigate and prosecute those who were working for Mr Coulson who tapped the phones of Cabinet Ministers Members of Parliament and other public figures

Here we go again with yet another counter terror Bill to tackle yet another threat posed by extremism yet another essential set of measures to keep our nation safe and to be rushed through at breakneck speed accompanied predictably by yet another escalation of the threat that we are supposed to be experiencing We are invited to believe that we are surrounded by terror plotters and backers jihadist bombers extremists and just good old fashioned nutters No one is safe threats are everywhere That is why we need this legislation as quickly as possible just as we have needed all the other Bills as quickly as possible There have been seven counter terrorism and security Bills since 9 11 all of which have been rushed through Parliament all of which have been absolutely necessary and all of which have been fast tracked I suspect that this will not be the last counter terrorism and security Bill In fact I do not suspect that it will be the last of the calendar year I suspect that there will be at least one more perhaps two and that they too will have to be rushed through Parliament to meet the escalating threat with which we must deal As we have heard so many times in so many speeches we live in an era in which there will always be an existing growing threat for us to address So what do we do We do the same things Every counter terrorism Bill that we have considered in the House could probably be characterised by a few key features that seem to crop up again and again We must gather retain and collect vast amounts of personal data from internet service providers In this instance internet protocols must be collected just in case we find something that could be used in the future That cause is very dear to the Home Secretary s heart because she still hankers after a snoopers charter She would probably have her way in the event of a majority Conservative Government next year because I fully expect it to be included in any Conservative manifesto We must continue to subject suspects to internal exile for that is exactly what we are doing I applauded the Conservatives when they reversed new Labour s control orders I thought that TPIMs were an improvement but we are back to what is effectively internal exile We are working towards depriving people of statehood We are preventing people from travelling and we are considering home arrest without trial It is all the usual stuff

I wish to speak about a very important matter that affects many people in Scotland It is certainly not the first time the issue has been raised in this place but unfortunately in the light of the circumstances it needs to be brought to the Government s attention again Yesterday when giving evidence to the Defence Committee on naval procurement for the Type 26 frigates First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff Tony Douglas replied in response to a question on when the Type 26 design would be approved I can t give you a time or a date It could be next year This suggestion could in effect place the Type 26 programme on the Clyde on an indefinite delay That would be wholly unacceptable and nothing short of a betrayal of the workers on the Clyde The Ministry of Defence needs to come forward and be absolutely clear open and honest about the level of uncertainty that the Type 26 programme faces The new Minister with responsibility for defence procurement the Under Secretary of State for Defence the hon Member for West Worcestershire Harriett Baldwin could give none of the assurances on the future of the contract that were promised to the Clyde shipyards Yet again the future of the programme has been cast into very serious doubt That news came less than 48 hours after the Tories trooped through the Division Lobby accompanied unfortunately by many of their allies on the Labour Benches to vote en masse for the renewal of Trident A blank cheque has in effect been written for weapons of mass destruction On Monday my hon Friend the Member for Argyll and Bute Brendan O Hara asked the Defence Secretary whether the massive expense of Trident and the recent analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies showing that UK GDP might be reduced by up to 3 5 as a result of the Brexit vote would result in a black hole in the public finances of up to 40 billion in 2020 and what that would mean for defence procurement The Defence Secretary could not give an answer

May I thank you Mr Speaker for granting this urgent debate and the Minister for his answer to the question The National Obesity Forum s report published today has led to a public outcry and confusion Indeed the conclusions of this report contradict much of the health and lifestyle advice issued by the Government and the NHS over the past decade Ordinary people are now caught in a whirlwind of conflicting advice at a time when they desperately need clarity consistency and straight talk Quite simply they do not know where to turn The Royal College of Physicians the Faculty of Public Health and the British Heart Foundation have all raised concerns about this report Some have claimed that local authorities schools and the NHS are receiving guidance from organisations whose funding and motivations are not known I welcome the use by the Minister of the word irresponsible in respect of this report The critical issue however is the delayed publication of the childhood obesity strategy We were first told that this would be published in December 2015 We were then told that it would be February 2016 It is now expected at the end of the summer No doubt you will confirm Mr Speaker that there is no clear indication from the Government as to when the end of the summer will be Amid the delays other voices are filling the void Clearly a strategy is required on what steps are needed to prevent and tackle the growing levels of obesity which at current rates are expected to reach 60 of the adult population by 2025 We need a definitive date for the publication of the strategy Will the Minister give us a date today In the Queen s Speech last week the introduction of a sugar tax was confirmed which I warmly welcome That could prevent 2 7 million people from being obese by 2025 Finally obesity is a leading cause of type 2 diabetes as the Minister has said Just as the rates of obesity are set to increase the number of people with diabetes is expected to rise to 5 million by 2025 As a type 2 diabetic and chair of the all party group for diabetes I live with how stark the situation is Sadly today s information tsunami has demonstrated a lack of leadership in public health Although the Public Health Minister should be commended for all the work she has done the Government must go further Failure to act now will jeopardise the future of our nation s health and the solvency of our national health service

I am very fond of the hon Lady but I think she has deliberately misunderstood what I was saying Judges regularly say in their summing up that they are taking into consideration the fact that because the person is a Member of Parliament they would lose their job as well if they were to be given a custodial sentence of more than a year It is a matter of fact that these matters are taken into consideration There is another problem with the Bill Having set a very high threshold that the courts or MPs get to decide whether somebody is subject to the recall process it then sets the very low threshold of 10 for throwing someone out As I said no Member has achieved election to this House by 50 of the total electorate so the idea that it would be difficult to find 10 to force them out of their seat notwithstanding the remarks of the hon Gentleman is to live in cloud cuckoo land If those two thresholds are wrong what is the right one Should we just leave it to the public which in essence is what we heard from the hon Member for Richmond Park As many Members have said there is a danger that the extremely wealthy could pervert the process they could spend lots of money in individual constituencies or perhaps 10 20 or 30 at a time and subvert the proper democratic process Arguably big money is already doing that in the British system We need to look again at how people spend money and at the rules governing not just general elections but by elections because the last thing I want is an American style democracy where only the rich can ever get elected Of course there is a danger of timid MPs but there is that danger today and the honest truth is I would trust the public I say this for a simple reason In 2003 I got into a bit of trouble with the electorate The Mail on Sunday and a whole load of journalists after the paper revealed that I had been using a gay dating website called Gaydar and there were pictures and so on The story was not quite as it was presented in some of the newspapers but be that as it may

It is a pleasure to follow the hon Member for Dartford Gareth Johnson who began and ended his speech with a call for unity reminding Members that we have heard some powerful speeches about this desperate situation and that even though we sitting in this Chamber today cannot solve this problem it is critical that we discuss it as often as we can I congratulate the hon Member for Moray Angus Robertson on leading this debate and congratulate the Scottish National party on reminding the House over the past few months of the very slow progress that has been made on the Syrian resettlement programme I offer a mea culpa from me and the Home Affairs Committee because we have not monitored as we should have done but we will do so in future as in order to make progress on resettlement we need to know that the process is actually working I also commend my hon Friend the Member for Wirral South Alison McGovern because many months ago she initiated an Adjournment debate about the Mediterranean crisis Two years ago the Select Committee visited the border between Turkey and Greece where we saw for ourselves that 100 000 people were crossing the border every year The real organisation and institution that has failed the refugees is not this House or this Government but the European Union and I say that as one of its great supporters The failure of the EU to put together a strategy over the past few years to deal with an inevitable crisis is a very serious indictment of that organisation Although we have had many speeches from Mr Juncker and others in the last few weeks if they had acted sooner we would all have been better prepared Greece and Italy have been asking for support for many years Greece has been saying that it needs additional financial support Those refugees who cross from Turkey to Faliraki in Greece were allowed to stay there for only six months They then travelled to Athens and they headed to northern Europe Some 92 of those who cross into Italy come from the failed state of Libya and the Italians have been asking for support over the last year but it has never been forthcoming Now it is a crisis for the whole of the EU It is right that we should congratulate the Prime Minister and the Government on announcing that we will take 20 000 refugees I am not convinced that the timescale is appropriate to the crisis and that is why yesterday the Home Affairs Committee the hon Member for Louth and Horncastle Victoria Atkins was also present pressed the Minister for Immigration for a target for each year He was unable to give us a target and I think that is wrong We need to make sure that we hold the Government to account not because we do not trust them to deliver on the 20 000 in five years but because Ministers officials will understand the seriousness of the situation only if we have constant scrutiny and a desire to make things work If we can have a net migration target I do not see why we cannot have a target for the number of refugees to enter this year That can be done and is deliverable and if the Minister puts his mind to it at his weekly meetings with his directors general he can make sure that the target is implemented What better way to convince the House of the sincerity of the Government s pledge the Prime Minister has been very sincere than to come back before the House at the end of this year and give us a figure that we can all be very proud of It would be easy to do that and I hope that the Government will do so The second issue I am concerned about is the fact that the resettlement of the Syrian refugees will be led by Cabinet Ministers who are already very busy I welcome the committee that has been set up under the joint chairmanship of the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government but what we need is a proper resettlement board We saw that for ourselves in Leicester when Idi Amin expelled the Ugandan Asians Without the structure of a resettlement board independent of Whitehall but of course drawing its authority from Parliament and the Government and necessarily getting resources from the Government to deal with the people who come here we will have many problems in dealing with the resettlement of Syrian refugees

Forgive the love in Mr Speaker but my hon Friend is a constant and persistent champion for his constituents in the many beautiful villages that he represents He is quite right to identify an issue that a number of people have raised with me across the country namely the transparency of the Planning Inspectorate That organisation is in the process of implementing the measures outlined in the Rosewell review in order for planning inquiries to provide more transparency We are at the moment procuring a new online IT system dread words in Government I know but nevertheless we are that will allow progress of appeals to be tracked providing exactly the sort of transparency that he is looking for

If my hon Friend s constituents are happy that is all right If the firm is Moss solicitors I have received a prodigious number of complaints about it Those complaints went to the legal ombudsman and led to the special report from that ombudsman Every single case involved Moss solicitors which is one of the most disgraceful firms in its handling of my constituents and my ability to represent them It is the sort of company that is prepared to ring people at home People who have never had dealings with a solicitor before making a complaint and who are rung up by solicitors feel highly intimidated That is what my constituents tell me It suggests that overall action should be taken against those solicitors The Government have paid that firm many millions of pounds in fees for its work Yet it wants to take other moneys to hand to people who have given it the claims uniquely it has worked for both the NUM and the UDM The two unions allegedly do not talk to each other but they clearly do with Moss solicitors

The commitment that was made at the G8 to aim for universal access to drugs treatment for HIV by 2010 was enormously important I am sure that the Prime Minister accepts that we need substantial and sustained increases in aid from developed countries beyond anything that has been agreed so far if we are to have any chance of achieving that aim With that in mind what are his objectives for the conference that will be held here in September on the replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria Does he accept that if that fund is not replenished that will send a signal that the G8 is not serious about the commitments that it made

It is not a bizarre argument because we would be introducing a service for a public who do not want it Does the hon Gentleman really expect that a young mother would decide not to go to a hospital where she could get all the intervention that she thinks she might require and that she has become used to over the years My constituency has one of the lowest rates of home births It is not the norm for mothers there to elect to have that form of delivery nor is it the norm for them to consider midwife led units If such a unit is set up without a proper explanation of how it can benefit mothers and without proper support does the hon Gentleman think that they will elect to go there

Yes I think it would be wrong to characterise the Russian veto in that way The veto exercised by Russia and China in February was against all the other 13 members of the United Nations Security Council which very much favoured a united international stand on this issue Nevertheless Russia has supported the Annan plan and has agreed with the two most recent UN resolutions That is why we continue to discuss the issues with them and to work with them I hope we can reach a common position with them on the implementation of the Annan plan or something very close to it

Having been Justice Secretary I am aware of and sympathetic to that issue My only caveat is that we must be careful Deeply distressing stories are heard in the family courts and we must not open them up in a way that exposes family heartache to the tabloid media I have always been cautious about that Equally the hon Gentleman is right to say that there is no real reason for the closed environment that exists around family courts That is a matter of concern to the Justice Secretary and there is cross party interest in what he is doing He will be in the House on Tuesday and I encourage the hon Gentleman to raise that important point

I apologise for missing the Minister s opening peroration I am sure it was very impressive and persuasive Politicians are generally speaking good talkers but poor listeners However I and many others listen carefully to the Queen s Speech I also try to listen to the Minister for Schools the Secretary of State for Education and the Department Indeed I listened carefully to their avowed policy aims excellence opportunity development and employability and I applaud them It is the explanation of their methods their solutions and their prescriptions that I have a problem with the restructuring the tinkering and the arbitrary diktats Frankly that is what most people have a problem with when it comes to this Government s particular policies but I still try to listen carefully to the arguments even for this I have picked out three features of their standard arguments that trouble me what I would call three persistent fallacies or three repeated mantras which I shall briefly sketch I hope that the Minister will be able to respond because I mean this to be a helpful critique First I do not know whether the Minister is familiar with the great Austrian philosopher Karl Popper but he drew a distinction between good and bad theories Good theories are testable and in principle falsifiable while bad theories can never be tested and are never falsifiable Mindful of that I have listened when the Minister has cited learned or professional opinion in support of Government policy and I have heard good evidence and good support but I have also listened when the Minister has declared that the total absence of any learned or professional backing for some policies is sure evidence that the Government are doing something challenging difficult important and of course right Either way the Government are correct and the policy is simply unfalsifiable The second fallacy follows on from that When Government policy prompts howls of protest from professionals and teachers as it often does that tends to suggest to the Government that the provider interest is being challenged in the interest of the pupils Recently they have talked darkly of vested interests That assumes erroneously that it is or could be in the interests of teachers not to deliver lessons that are relevant appropriate and interesting to pupils and aligned with pupils development and capabilities Well just try doing that not delivering good lessons if you are a teacher Teachers who try not to do it in any educational context generally crash and burn The conflict of interests is simply an illusion The third fallacy to which I wish to draw the Minister s attention is the tendency to announce a policy with a laudable objective which is designed to solve a problem but which is of doubtful efficacy and then to suggest that rather than its being subjected to proper assessment it is necessary to press on with it immediately and imperatively That was the language that surrounded the coasting schools debate No day could be lost it was said or the pupil would suffer irrecoverably and would never catch up Unevidenced policy must be applied forthwith We can imagine how much harm would be done if the same policy were applied in medical circles I have invented none of that Those are the standard arguments that I have heard put by a beleaguered Department from the Government Front Bench and I do genuinely try to listen Let us forget the dogma and the prejudice behind the policy for a moment and look only at the logic The logic of the Government s position is quite troubling Dark talk about specific vested interests I do not know whether that refers to the unions the teachers the parents or the academics or talk of what used to be known as The Blob smacks of paranoia rather than rationality and critical thinking of which the Government are supposedly in favour Always seeing critics as enemies is the mark of a zealot not a feature of sane leisured policy making Let me impress on the Government that I am in favour of sane leisured policy making and of buying in from as many stakeholders as possible

I do not think that there is a time in recent history when there was a greater need for a Committee of the kind that we are discussing this evening I also believe that the issues that we are concerned with in 2010 largely turn on the question of who governs Britain and how Those are matters that the Committee should and must look at very carefully indeed One point that I would like to put to the Leader of the House or the Deputy Leader of the House if he is replying to the debate is this are we sure that there will be an opportunity for the momentous issues put forward in the coalition agreement to be considered by the Committee before the decisions are taken and put through I am thinking for example of the question of the alternative vote and the referendum on it I am also thinking of whether other referendums of the kind that relate to the European Union would be considered by the Committee and given full weight in the light of the fact that for so much of the legislation that goes through this House it is in fact incumbent on us to pass it because of section 2 of European Communities Act 1972 That raises the question of sovereignty which is another matter that has to be considered in the Committee before decisions are taken because the fact is that the sovereignty of this House is not just the sovereignty of this House it is the sovereignty of the people who elect us to this House This is their Parliament not ours For that reason sovereignty is another matter that needs to be given the most careful consideration Then there is the issue of fixed term Parliaments which my hon Friend the Member for Wellingborough Mr Bone mentioned and the 55 rule that is being brought forward Is that not something that the Committee should look at If we are serious about the importance of a Select Committee to look into such matters with powers as the motion says to send for persons papers and records to adjourn and to report from time to time and to appoint specialist advisers is it not incumbent on us in passing it to be aware that it is essential that such matters should be considered by the Committee before decisions are taken Otherwise the motion might turn out to be no more than an empty piece of paper Then there is the further issue which my hon Friend also mentioned of the West Lothian question along with the whole question of devolution I look across the Chamber to the Members from the Democratic Unionist party and other minority parties These are huge issues they are not just minor matters to be rammed through at a moment s notice They need careful and proper consideration and the Committee would be able to give them just that I should also mention the fact that the coalition agreement contains proposals on the sovereignty issue which has now been taken out of our manifesto commitments much to my regret and put into what I hope will not be the long grass so that there can be a proper consideration of the necessity of having a sovereignty Act a gold standard sovereignty Act if I may say so along the lines of that which I have proposed which has been approved by eminent constitutional authorities The reason for that necessity is that there are occasions already when measures go through at least three such measures have gone through the European system without proper consideration by the European Scrutiny Committee and they are matters that would normally be subject to scrutiny reserve The Leader of the House has kindly replied to me this evening regarding my concern on those points They are huge matters affecting the entire economy of this country and its stabilisation not to mention the City of London regulation and many other things Then there is the whole question of human rights That is another matter that might overlap to some extent with another Select Committee but it is a matter of enormous importance because it affects the entire social fabric of the nation The Lord Chief Justice himself has recently remarked that we must beware of the manner in which the common law is being superseded by the decisions and precedents being taken by our judiciary at the expense of the common law He mentioned in particular the Strasbourg convention let alone the Human Rights Act itself In a recent and very important speech Lord Hoffmann a former Law Lord pointed out that the Strasbourg Court aggrandises itself and believes that it is no more than a federal system In a speech the other day the Deputy Prime Minister described the Reform Act of 1832 as the basis for the reforms now being proposed There have been several Reform Acts but the 1832 Act in itself was far less important than the Reform Act of 1867 and the Acts that followed from it for the simple reason that the Reform Act of 1867 resulted from a massive campaign by the people of this country in the wake of the repeal of the corn laws to ensure that there was a proper and democratic system whereby the people s own views would be expressed in general elections on a scale commensurate with the requirements of the time I must point out with respect to the Deputy Prime Minister that the 1832 Act was necessary to get rid of corrupt rotten boroughs although it did not prevent rotten boroughs from persisting The borough of Stafford which I had the honour to represent for about 14 years was up for the chop in 1835 The Bill to disfranchise the electors of Stafford was passed in the House of Commons and they were only saved by the intervention of a general election This is an issue of the greatest importance Parliamentary reform radical parliamentary reform is fundamental to the future of this Parliament and of this nation I believe that the Committee can do the job but it will not be able to do the job that is being prescribed for it if decisions have already been made under the coalition Government and agreement or otherwise which pre empt its ability to make recommendations about the seminal reforms that are needed to return true democracy to this country

Does the Minister agree that the innovative technology sector is very important for trade between Japan and the United Kingdom in which we in Northern Ireland excel Will he ensure that the sector is promoted very heavily in Japanese United Kingdom relationships for the benefit of the Japanese workforce but particularly of those who are developing the sector here

I begin by congratulating the hon Member for Colchester Bob Russell on what he has just said I was proud to sign his early day motion and I would like to reassure him about one thing I do not know what the parliamentary term for scum is but when people such as those in the British National party behave in the way he described we can be all the more reassured about how right we are to condemn oppose and disrespect them and all their works I only hope that despite all the provocations from Westminster to our constituents they nevertheless have the maturity and good sense to do the same to the BNP in the elections today However in the spirit of partisanship which I cannot entirely resist I say to the hon Gentleman that if it were not for the Liberal Democrats policy of proportional representation the prospects of the BNP leader entering the European Parliament would be much smaller In March 2008 I had the privilege of giving a joint presentation I must stress that I was very much the junior partner to a group called First Defence of which I was the parliamentary chairman The presentation was entitled Counter Insurgency in Principle and Practice I was talking about some of the principles of counter insurgency but the person everyone came to listen to was Dr David Kilcullen who was talking about his experiences in practice in Iraq One of the most important points about people such as Dr Kilcullen who was among other things a special adviser to General Petraeus and subsequently to Condoleezza Rice is that the architects of what we hope will be the ultimately successful strategy in Iraq are also some of the people who are least dogmatic about the methods that one can adopt to deal with terrorists and insurgents In his book The Accidental Guerrilla which has just been published Dr Kilcullen says that in many cases the people against whom we find ourselves fighting would not have taken up arms against us had we not gone into their countries in the first place That is a message that one gets from all parts of the House although it is at the same time acknowledged that sometimes even though such fighting is a consequence of our having had to go into those countries we had little alternative However as Dr Kilcullen stresses we should do so only as a last resort I have pointed out previously that there are some similarities between orthodox political campaigning and the methods used by terrorist groups albeit not in the moral dimension There are at least five principles that terrorist groups adopt I shall quickly list them The first is always fight on ground where you are strongest and your opponent weakest The next two are always seek maximum impact for minimum effort and try to manoeuvre your opponent into a situation where he is damned if he does but damned if he doesn t That is precisely what I described in relation to the reaction in the case of Afghanistan when an attack was mounted against the American homeland from a country in which it would be difficult and bloody to intervene The last two principles are use your opponent s own weight to drag him down military jiu jitsu and apply these methods simultaneously and repeatedly To a large extent the methods adopted by the Americans and the British have been to try to use conventional military power against such unconventional enemies We need to try to avoid being bled dry however in a form of warfare that involves fighting on the enemy s strongest ground not ours Of the many wise words in Dr Kilcullen s latest book which I commend to Members in all parts of the House he says In military terms for AQ al Qaeda the main effort is information for us information is a supporting effort Thus to combat al Qaeda propaganda we need a capacity for strategic information warfare an integrating function that draws together all components of what we say and what we do to send strategic messages that support our overall policy

Last year saw a whole range of events in Parliament to mark the centenary of some women getting the right to vote and this year marks 100 years since the first woman took her seat in Parliament I was really proud to take part in a lot of those events last year and I know a lot of progress has been made Other Members have mentioned the House of Commons nursery which enabled me to put myself forward for Parliament I have placed on record my thanks to those who made that happen particularly you Mr Speaker However when we talk about wanting to have a more diverse Parliament and we have things such as the nursery is it not a contradiction that we have not yet introduced proxy voting Does the Leader of the House agree that it is long overdue and that if we want to break down barriers to women entering Parliament we do need to take this very swift action

Madam Deputy Speaker may I say what a pleasure it is to see you in the Chair after the recess It is also a pleasure to realise that I have an hour and 16 minutes in which to address my response to my hon Friend the Member for The Cotswolds Sir Geoffrey Clifton Brown but I may cut it down just a little bit to please the House I thank my hon Friend for bringing this important debate to the House tonight It is entirely characteristic of him that such a debate is in his name because throughout his parliamentary career he has been a strong advocate of business both across the country and importantly in his constituency He was right to highlight in his opening remarks the sheer size and importance of our small business community there are 5 7 million small businesses a figure that he cited and the recent growth that we have had under the coalition Government and this Government He has worked closely with the British Independent Retailers Association on various thoughts and proposals some of which he put forward this evening and to which I shall respond in a moment My hon Friend is right that business rates are an important tax When we consulted on business rates back in 2015 and considered the various alternatives several different suggestions were made such as turnover taxes taxes on gross value added and so on Inevitably with every kind of measure or metric that one focused on they had their own particular drawbacks and complexities and so on The conclusion that was reached at the time was that business rates were a stable tax that is difficult to avoid because property is static by definition Of course as my hon Friend also rightly pointed out business rates raise around 25 billion a year which is a significant contribution to our public services and funds in turn our doctors nurses policemen and policewomen and so on The Government recognise that business rates represent a high pressure on small businesses particularly for high street retailers Rates are a fixed cost that cannot be avoided irrespective of whether a business is profitable or otherwise which is why we have undertaken a series of important measures In the 2016 Budget we made 100 small business rate relief permanent at that time increasing the threshold for the relief and taking 655 000 of the smallest businesses out of business rates altogether We also increased the threshold for the standard multiplier taking 250 000 properties including most high street shops out of the higher rate of business rates However that is not all Following the most recent property revaluation in 2017 we introduced a 3 6 billion transitional relief scheme to cap and phase in bill increases Additionally at spring Budget 2017 we announced an extra 435 million to support those businesses facing the steepest increases in bills including 110 million to support 16 000 small businesses losing small business rate relief or rural rate relief to limit increases in their bills to the greater of 600 a year or the real terms transitional relief cap for small businesses in each year We also provided local authorities with 300 million of funding for discretionary relief to support individual cases in their local area In parallel to all that we have taken significant steps to ensure the fairness of the business rates system as a whole That is why at spring Budget 2017 the Chancellor announced that we would reform the revaluation process to make it fairer I am pleased to say that we have delivered on that by increasing the frequency of business rates revaluations from every five years to every three years following the next revaluation That is an important point in the context of what my hon Friend said about the difference in the rates being paid by the out of town store and by retailers on the high street If we can have more frequent revaluations as rateable values on the high street perhaps fall we can more quickly pass on the benefit of that within the system

With permission Mr Speaker I shall respond to everything that the Leader of the House set out the business for next week and after the recess and the statement about recess questions I welcome the right hon Gentleman s announcement that hon Members will be able to table written questions during the recess albeit for a limited period My hon Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell Chris Grayling raised the matter in business questions on 21 July 2005 at column 1415 of Hansard when he asked for immediate action It was not quite immediate but at least something has happened and the Leader of the House is to be congratulated on that However will he confirm that the extension for written questions includes those to the Home Office and that the Department will respond fully in the time set out May I urge him to go further What plans has he to extend the opportunities to ask written questions during the summer recess in future He also announced provision for written ministerial statements In the absence of the Order Paper what plans has he to alert hon Members to the statements either when they are made or through advance notice I thank the Leader of the House for giving us the business for next week and the week after the recess Yesterday I welcomed his decision to change today s business to enable the House to debate the growing crisis in the middle east As that crisis develops a further statement might well be needed before the recess Will the Foreign Secretary come to the House next week to update hon Members on the situation and the Government s position Sadly today s debate has meant postponing the debate on international development We previously had such a debate in Government time a year ago on Africa Will the Leader of the House give us an assurance that there will be a debate on international development as soon as possible after our return from the recess and certainly before the end of the Session On Tuesday many hon Members were lobbied by constituents about cuts in physiotherapy services I met Kate from Twyford who told me that 2 500 physiotherapists will graduate this year and probably only 250 will get jobs because of cuts in the national health service Last year the Government encouraged universities to increase training places for physiotherapists This year more than 2 000 graduates will fail to get a job When we return may we have a debate on physiotherapy services May we also have a debate in the autumn on Britain s influence in the world Today s debate will concentrate on the middle east but on our role in world affairs I was struck by the exchange between the Prime Minister and the President of the United States which was reported earlier this week at the G8 summit The Prime Minister offered to visit the middle east to try and see what the lie of the land is The reply was I think Condi is going to go pretty soon What did Prime Minister say Well it s only if I mean you know if she s got a or if she needs the ground prepared as it were Because obviously if she goes out she s got to succeed if it were whereas I can go out and just talk What a revelation That was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom speaking First it tells us what we have always known the Prime Minister does not do anything he simply talks Secondly what does it say about the UK My noble Friend Lord Hurd once described Britain as punching above its weight in foreign affairs Today the Prime Minister sees himself as the warm up act for the US Secretary of State We need a debate on our role in the world May we also have a debate on ministerial responsibilities A review of four Departments has shown significant failure to deliver On ability to plan resources prioritise and deliver value for money setting aside the Home Office s poor performance the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Department for Work and Pensions were Not well placed to address weaknesses urgent action needed The Prime Minister s response was to say that the Departments central headquarters would now focus on high level strategy and priority setting managing performance and tackling failure and building up skills What on earth have they been doing for the past nine years Speaking of reviews when the Government were first elected in 1997 the Prime Minister made much of his commitment to produce an annual report each year On 18 July 2001 he said In respect of annual reports it is important that we set out the Government s achievements and lack of achievements in whichever year we are in power The last annual report was published in 2000 When will the next one be published May we have a debate before the end of the Session on the Government s record over the past year and a half As we are approaching the summer recess I do not want to over burden civil servants with this task so I shall offer some suggestions on what the Government s annual report might cover It could include U turns on home information packs self assessment tax returns council tax revaluation prison building sentencing policy and police mergers It could cover abandoned projects such as hospital star ratings regional assemblies and the abolition of the Lord Chancellor Further subjects might include the information technology projects left in chaos at the Child Support Agency the Rural Payments Agency the Criminal Records Bureau the Passport Office and the NHS

I caution the hon Gentleman against making decisions on the basis of speculation about different alternatives The clear view of the tripartite authorities was that there was not a viable private sector alternative and we spent time seeking such an alternative and seeking private sector bids However we have not received an appropriate private sector bid that meets the terms that we require to ensure that we get a good deal for the taxpayer It is right that we should make such a requirement Transferring Northern Rock into temporary public ownership by contrast means that the taxpayer will receive any upside from a future sale of the business which better aligns risk with reward
