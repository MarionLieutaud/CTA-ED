# "Computational Text Analysis" (PGSP11584) {.unnumbered}

![cover](coverb.png){.cover width="250"} This is the dedicated webpage for the course Computational Text Analysis" [(PGSP11584)](http://www.drps.ed.ac.uk/23-24/dpt/cxpgsp11584.htm) at the University of Edinburgh, convened and taught by Dr. Marion Lieutaud. The structure below will give you an overview of the course. The key ideas and objectives for the course are described in more details in the Course overview and the Introduction tabs; these also include a short introduction to the programming language R, which we will use throughout the course.

We will be using this online book all throughout the term. Each week has a set of essential and recommended readings. The essential readings must be consulted in full prior to the Lecture and Seminar for that week. In addition, you will find online exercises and examples written in R. This is a "live" book and will be amended and updated during the term as we progress through the course.

## Structure

The course is structured of alternating weeks of substantive and technical instructions.

| Week | Focus                                        | Coding assignment(s)                                                                                                                                                              | Class activity                                                                                                             |
