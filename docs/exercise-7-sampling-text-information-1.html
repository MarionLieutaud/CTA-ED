<li>Manually review</li>
<li>Compare to reference data (<span class="citation">Alshaabi et al. (<a href="references-2.html#ref-alshaabi_storywrangler_2021" role="doc-biblioref">2021</a>)</span>)</li>

<p>A first step in any text analysis technique should be to eyeball your data and the results of any analysis you carry out. This might not sound very formalized as an approach—and it isn’t—but it is what every good practitioner will find themselves doing at some stage.</p>
<p>Some refer to this kind of check as a “sanity check.” What would such a check look like in practice?</p>
<p>Well, let’s take an example from the beginning of the course, where we looked at event descriptions from the Edinburgh International Book Festival.</p>
<p>We’ll first read in this data.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">edbfdata</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html">read_csv</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"data/wordfreq/edbookfestall.csv"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## New names:
## * `` -&gt; ...1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Rows: 5938 Columns: 12
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: ","
## chr (8): festival_id, title, sub_title, artist, description, genre, age_cate...
## dbl (4): ...1, year, latitude, longitude
## 
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.</code></pre>
<p>As ever, if you’re working on this document from your own computer (“locally”) you can download the Book Festival data in the following way:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb5"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb5-1"><a href="exercise-7-sampling-text-information-1.html#cb5-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>edbfdata <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read_csv</span>(<span class="st">"https://github.com/cjbarrie/CTA-ED/blob/main/data/wordfreq/edbookfestall.csv"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We’ll get the data into tidy format as before, tagging individual words for whether or not they appear in our dictionary of woman- and gender-related terms. One addition here is that we’re ascribing each event an individual ID, which will be useful in the next step.</p>

The Ayrshire author has taken time out of her fictional endeavours to pen the latest instalment of her memoir. All Made Up takes the story into her teenage years and focuses on the morals and ambitions of one small town through the stories of three generations of women. Galloway was struggling to make sense of the changes caused by adolescence, and almost everything began to feel different. Today, she shares her growing pains with the Guardian&amp;rsquo;s Literary Editor, Claire Armitstead.&lt;/p&gt;

This event brings together two brilliant authors whose novels offer tremendous insight into the effects of the Second World War on the women who experienced it. Simon Mawer and Mich&amp;egrave;le Roberts, each previously shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, discuss their new novels. In both stories, women in very different situations are driven to behave in courageous, sometimes shocking ways.&lt;/p&gt;

Less than 100 years ago women didn&amp;rsquo;t have the same right to swim as men and could be arrested for taking the plunge until the 1930s. Jenny Landreth&amp;rsquo;s joyful book Swell, shortlisted for the William Hill Sports Book of the Year 2017, charmingly tells the story of the swimming suffragettes who took to the water to take on the status quo, and won. Spend an hour with Landreth and dive into the past.&lt;/p&gt;

Subtitled Sex, Censorship and the Criminalisation of Love, it explores Britain&amp;rsquo;s obscenity laws which criminalised homosexuality. The American journalist&amp;#39;s book also reveals some of the lives lived in the shadow of these laws, connecting regressive Victorian ideas and modern notions of deviancy, free expression and love.&lt;/p&gt;

Ugandan short story writer and novelist Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi burst onto the scene when she won The Kwani? Manuscript Project in 2013 with her first novel &lt;em&gt;Kintu&lt;/em&gt;. Since then, she&amp;rsquo;s garnered legions of readers and accolades including a Commonwealth Short Story Prize and, in 2018, a Windham Campbell Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Her work is celebrated for its links to oral traditions as well as its incisive critiques of contemporary Ugandan politics. For this event, she discusses her latest novel, &lt;em&gt;The First Woman&lt;/em&gt;, with editor and culture columnist of The Economist &lt;strong&gt;Fiammetta Rocco.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Makumbi&amp;#39;s brilliantly realised story follows the young headstrong Kirabo as she comes to understand her place in the world, and her identity as a woman. In the words of Caine Prize-winning author Namwali Serpell: &amp;lsquo;With wry wisdom, great humour, and deep complexity, Makumbi has created a feminist coming-of-age classic for the ages, sure to join the company of Charlotte Bront&amp;euml;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Jane Eyre&lt;/em&gt;, Zora Neale Hurston&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Their Eyes Were Watching God&lt;/em&gt;, Tsitsi Dangarembga&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Nervous Conditions&lt;/em&gt;, and Elena Ferrante&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Neapolitan Quartet&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

In November, the United States will embark on arguably its most consequential political election in decades, as President Donald Trump seeks another term in office. In the 2018 midterms, a record 117 women were elected to office, including record numbers of women of colour and LGBTIQA+ women.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Despite historic gains, there has never been a female head of state in the 244-year history of the United States. How can a mounting sense of anger, awareness and organisation &amp;ndash; and the rise in women representatives &amp;ndash; influence and shape the political outcomes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This year, 18 August is the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which granted all women in the US the right to vote &amp;ndash; although this right was not exercised equally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Leading voices in politics and human rights join &lt;strong&gt;Francesca Donner&lt;/strong&gt;, gender director at the New York Times, to explore the evolving role of women shaping the political agenda and its impact on women&amp;rsquo;s rights around the world. Our panel includes former United States Ambassador to the United Nations &lt;strong&gt;Samantha Power&lt;/strong&gt;, acclaimed Turkish author &lt;strong&gt;Elif Shafak&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Veronica Chambers,&lt;/strong&gt; editor of &lt;em&gt;The Meaning of Michelle: 16 Writers on the Iconic First Lady and How Her Journey Inspires Our Own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Liz Hyder&amp;rsquo;s multi award-winning debut &lt;em&gt;Bearmouth&lt;/em&gt; is a novel so utterly original it swallows you up entirely and spits you out feeling bereft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From the first page you are transported underground, down into the world of a functioning mine and the mind of one of its youngest workers. Newt&amp;rsquo;s life is one of hard labour and injustices but our hero is fortunate to have a tight-knit group of friends, including Thomas, who teaches Newt how to read and write between gruelling shifts. Everything changes when a new miner joins them, bringing talk of revolution and unrest along with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dark and distinctive, &lt;em&gt;Bearmouth&lt;/em&gt; explores ideas around oppression, autonomy, gender and religion while Newt&amp;rsquo;s voice is so powerful it will echo in the chambers of your mind long after you finish reading.

While this year&amp;rsquo;s release of &lt;em&gt;Breasts and Eggs&lt;/em&gt; marks the first time Mieko Kawakami has been translated into English (by Sam Bett and David Boyd), she has been a literary sensation in Japan for more than ten years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Her legions of fans include Haruki Murakami, who cites her as a favourite, and &lt;em&gt;Breasts and Eggs&lt;/em&gt; started life as a blog attracting hundreds of thousands of readers. And it&amp;rsquo;s not hard to see why: unapologetically feminist and gleefully subversive, this is an incisive account of three young women navigating and carving out their place in contemporary Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;lsquo;The characters and stories that appear in Japanese literature tend to perpetuate Orientalist views &amp;mdash; the idea that Japanese people are slightly odd and mysterious, but harmless,&amp;rsquo; Kawakami said. &amp;lsquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want to write anything that helps to reinforce that kind of a misunderstanding. I made an effort to depict life as it truly feels to live it in Japan.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From breast enhancement to motherhood, single life and sisterly obligation, this is an unforgettable story from one of Japan&amp;rsquo;s rising stars. Come and hear her talk to writer and Guardian critic &lt;strong&gt;Catherine Taylor&lt;/strong&gt; about her work.&lt;/p&gt;

At 83, Maryse Cond&amp;eacute; is one of the most significant voices of our time. The Guadeloupean novelist, critic and playwright has had a career festooned with honours and awards, including the New Academy Prize in Literature, the substitute for the 2018 Nobel Prize for Literature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Radical activism has characterised much of her work &amp;ndash; &amp;lsquo;I could not write anything… unless it has a certain political significance. I have nothing else to offer that remains important.&amp;rsquo; After resisting being seen as an autobiographical writer early in her career, Cond&amp;eacute;&amp;rsquo;s later work has drawn heavily on her childhood, her forebears and themes of gender, class and race relations in the postcolonial Caribbean and West Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Her new book (translated from French by her translator and husband Richard Philcox) is &lt;em&gt;The Wondrous and Tragic Lives of Ivan and Ivana&lt;/em&gt;. Written in the shadow of the Charlie Hebdo attack, it is a searing novel about the resistance of binaries.

Of the five women who died in the Autumn of 1888 at the hands of Jack the Ripper, the most salient thing that has remained in the public imagination has been the brutal manner of their murders. While the identity of the murderer has been the subject of relentless, salacious speculation, only now have the stories of those who were killed been told.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Hallie Rubenhold&amp;rsquo;s landmark publication, &lt;em&gt;The Five,&lt;/em&gt; reconstructs the lost lives of Mary Ann &amp;#39;Polly&amp;#39; Nichols, Annie Chapman, Elizabeth Stride, Catherine Eddowes and Mary Jane Kelly. So compelling is Rubenhold&amp;rsquo;s book that it won last year&amp;rsquo;s Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In today&amp;rsquo;s event, Rubenhold discusses a new essay, &lt;em&gt;The Problem with Great Men&lt;/em&gt;, commissioned by Edinburgh International Book Festival as a follow-up to &lt;em&gt;The Five&lt;/em&gt;, with support from Baillie Gifford and the Baillie Gifford Prize for Non-Fiction. &lt;a href=“<a href="https://www.bailliegifford.com/literature-library/miscellaneous/bg-prize-booklet-the-problem-with-great-men/%22%3EYou" class="uri">https://www.bailliegifford.com/literature-library/miscellaneous/bg-prize-booklet-the-problem-with-great-men/"&gt;You</a> can download the essay here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many people are calling into question the histories handed down to us by our ancestors. With statues of so-called &amp;lsquo;great men&amp;rsquo; being torn down, how can we celebrate ordinary people who &amp;ndash; like the Ripper&amp;rsquo;s victims &amp;ndash; have routinely been airbrushed out of history?

More than a decade in the making, Hilary Mantel&amp;rsquo;s masterpiece is now complete with the publication of the final part of her Thomas Cromwell trilogy, &lt;em&gt;The Mirror and The Light.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As any student of 16th century England knows, Cromwell&amp;rsquo;s life ended abruptly with his beheading in 1540. In common with &lt;em&gt;Wolf Hall &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Bring Up the Bodies&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Mirror and The Light&lt;/em&gt; places readers inside the head of Cromwell and it&amp;rsquo;s no spoiler to say that Mantel&amp;rsquo;s new book ends with the removal of that same head. But Mantel&amp;rsquo;s novels are about so much more than one fascinating, complicated man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In today&amp;rsquo;s event filmed at Hilary Mantel&amp;rsquo;s home in Devon, Guardian chief culture writer &lt;strong&gt;Charlotte Higgins&lt;/strong&gt; also talks to the double Booker Prize winner about her subtle depictions of women including Anne Boleyn, and about the vivid, nuanced and compelling re-creation of a 16th century world from a 21st century perspective.

A leading figure in Argentine and Latin American literature, Gabriela Cabez&amp;oacute;n C&amp;aacute;mara is one of the most prominent feminist intellectuals of the region. Her fourth novel, &lt;em&gt;The Adventures of China Iron&lt;/em&gt; is shortlisted for this year&amp;rsquo;s International Booker Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A radical retelling of the 1872 classic &lt;em&gt;El Gaucho Mart&amp;iacute;n Fierro&lt;/em&gt; by Jos&amp;eacute; Hern&amp;aacute;ndez, it centres the story on Fierro&amp;rsquo;s wife, following her quest for emancipation and a new life. It&amp;#39;s a masterpiece of formally playful, narratively expansive, tonally joyous storytelling. Flanked by her Scottish friend and companion, Liz, China&amp;rsquo;s journey is by turns a literary subversion, a rollicking account of a road trip, a hallucinatory tour of the perils of colonisation and a critique of nationalist myth building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alongside her translators &lt;strong&gt;Fiona Mackintosh&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Iona Macintyre&lt;/strong&gt;, Cabez&amp;oacute;n C&amp;aacute;mara makes a welcome return to the Edinburgh International Book Festival, following her visit in 2019, to discuss the challenges and delights of reimagining a classic work of literature with fellow Argentinian novelist and writer &lt;strong&gt;Mariana Enriquez&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

As part of the Book Festival&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=“<a href="https://www.edbookfest.co.uk/the-festival/whats-on/introducing-outriders-africa%22%3EOutriders" class="uri">https://www.edbookfest.co.uk/the-festival/whats-on/introducing-outriders-africa"&gt;Outriders</a> programme&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;exploring the shifting landscapes of contemporary Africa, rising star of Scottish poetry Nadine Aisha Jassat embarked on a poignant journey across the south-east of the continent with Zimbabwe-based writer and film-maker Tsitsi Dangarembga, whose 1988 debut Nervous Conditions was included in the BBC&amp;#39;s 2018 list of the 100 books that shaped the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fascinated by the rich tradition of storytelling in their shared Zimbabwean ancestry and the voices erased within it, they set out to retrace the funereal route of David Livingstone, whose body was carried from modern day Zambia to the coast of Tanzania by his two attendants, Susi and Chuma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Their adventure took an unexpected turn when Jassat was forced to return to the UK at short notice during the height of the pandemic, leaving Dangarembga to complete the journey solo. They share their unforgettable experience, and some of the writing it inspired, with researcher &lt;strong&gt;Kate Simpson&lt;/strong&gt;, whose own work seeks to bring the stories of the women of Livingstone&amp;rsquo;s expeditions out from the shadows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is a pre-recorded audio-only event.&lt;/p&gt;

In Maaza Mengiste&amp;rsquo;s latest novel, the shadowy nature of figures from the past is played out in complex and interlocking ways. &lt;em&gt;The Shadow King&lt;/em&gt; is powerful, stirring historical fiction that centres women within stories of war and battle that have traditionally excluded them, eliding their contribution and their fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Against the backdrop of Italy&amp;rsquo;s 1935 invasion of Ethiopia, this is a story of Africa and Europe, of resistance and exile, of tradition and modernity, that is sweeping in vision and intimate in affect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A Fulbright scholar and the author of &lt;em&gt;Beneath the Lion&amp;rsquo;s Gaze&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; named by the Guardian as one of the 10 best contemporary African books &amp;mdash; Mengiste talks to &lt;strong&gt;Jess Brough&lt;/strong&gt; about giving life to the stories of her parents and grandparents, and unpicking &amp;lsquo;faded documents&amp;rsquo; to better understand the heroism and loss of the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Seeking to decode where love lies for women in modern Africa are two of its literary scene&amp;rsquo;s most charming characters: Donna Obaseki-Ogunnaike, an Energy Law expert, poet, writer and theatre practitioner, previously dubbed the &amp;#39;queen of spoken word poetry in Nigeria&amp;rsquo;; and Wanjiru Koinange, a Kenyan writer, raised on a farm on the outskirts of Nairobi, whose mission to restore Nairobi&amp;rsquo;s iconic public libraries with her social enterprise Book Bunk has received wide praise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
During surprising, funny and moving conversations, they quizzed a vast array of women across the West African region about hookup culture, how their cities inspire companionship, and whether romance really is dead. Joined by writers &lt;strong&gt;Renee&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Akitelek Mboya&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Efua Oyofo&lt;/strong&gt;, two of the women they met along the way, Obaseki-Ogunnaike and Koinange today share their responses from these unforgettable interviews.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;lsquo;You were always sitting in character, you were just never sure which one.&amp;rsquo; So says Norah to the memory of her mother in &lt;em&gt;Actress&lt;/em&gt;, the new novel by Anne Enright. The mother in question is Katherine O&amp;rsquo;Dell, who died aged 58 &amp;ndash; the same age Norah has now reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Actress&lt;/em&gt; is a portrait of life in the theatre, of one woman&amp;rsquo;s rise to fame and her subsequent decline, with all the challenges that women on stage faced in the years before the #MeToo movement shone light on them. But this novel is also a tender examination of the relationship between mother and daughter &amp;ndash; the reconstruction of an emotional landscape in which fame has left a trail of newspaper articles, photographs and public performances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For this event, the Booker Prize-winning novelist is joined by &lt;strong&gt;Vicky Featherstone,&lt;/strong&gt; Artistic Director of the Royal Court Theatre and the first Artistic Director of the National Theatre of Scotland, to discuss this sensitive portrayal of a life lived in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;

One of a rising generation of talented Argentine writers, Selva Almada burst onto the English-language book scene last year with the publication of &lt;em&gt;The Wind that Lays Waste&lt;/em&gt;, a short but highly-charged novel that won the Book Festival&amp;rsquo;s 2019 First Book Award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
She returns with a searing, devastating hybrid book which could be described as journalistic fiction or fictional journalism. &lt;em&gt;Dead Girls&lt;/em&gt; reimagines the lives of three real-life small-town teenagers who were murdered in the 1980s &amp;ndash; young women who in many ways were not dissimilar to Almada herself. Their murderers were never brought to justice and the killings were routinely dismissed by locals due to the girls&amp;rsquo;s impoverished, working-class backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since then, countless femicides &amp;ndash; as well as an increase in violence towards LGBTIQA+ people &amp;ndash; have come to light not only in Latin America but across the world. Almada&amp;rsquo;s unforgettable, necessary book is not only hard-hitting, it is a plangent call to action. She discusses &lt;em&gt;Dead Girls&lt;/em&gt; with bestselling Argentinian writer and journalist &lt;a href=“<a href="https://www.edbookfest.co.uk/writers/mariana-enriquez%22%3E%3Cstrong%3EMariana" class="uri">https://www.edbookfest.co.uk/writers/mariana-enriquez"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mariana</a> Enriquez&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Drawn to the unique flora and fauna that permeates southern Africa and curious about how it might reflect the land on which it grows, Scottish visual artist and writer Dr Amanda Thomson and poet Nadine Aisha Jassat, deemed one of 30 Inspiring Young Women Under 30 in Scotland by YWCA Scotland, found themselves wandering the steep slopes of Table Mountain and Cape Point National Park, and discovering the innovative horticultural practices of Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thomson was later joined by writer Sabrina Mahfouz, herself interested in contrasting her experience growing up in urban environments with life on the Cape Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While their journey was sadly cut short due to COVID-19, that won&amp;rsquo;t stop these incisive voices from sharing their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

As America seemingly implodes its way toward the 2020 election, pundits and political classes continue to try to understand how the Land of the Free has found itself in such disarray. And &amp;mdash; as it has throughout Western democracies &amp;mdash; the conversation inevitably turns to shifting facets of identity politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Conversations around race and gender have moved in significant, seismic ways in recent times, and the roles played by class and education remain widely understood. But Pulitzer Prize-winning author Isabel Wilkerson&amp;rsquo;s major new work argues that there&amp;rsquo;s another factor controlling American society; one with far-reaching and profound effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
She has turned her celebrated journalistic eye to what she describes as the unspoken system of power and control that underpins American society: caste. In this insightful event chaired by Pakistani writer &lt;strong&gt;Fatima Bhutto,&lt;/strong&gt; Wilkerson answers your questions on how this unforgettable reframing of what divides Americans might impact their future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Gender non-conforming and sexually diverse people are oppressed, persecuted and erased all over the world. The cultural concepts used to justify this &amp;mdash; religious or secular, traditional or imported &amp;mdash; are various, as are the histories that got us here. But wherever we live in the world and whatever version of patriarchy we live under, the damage done is universal. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So in this traumatic global context, how does an LGBTIQA+ Arab end up making public art? What are the specific challenges and priorities for these queer artists with Arab heritage, and how do creativity and activism interweave in their work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Novelist, memoirist and journalist &lt;strong&gt;Randa Jarrar,&lt;/strong&gt; documentary playwright and theatremaker &lt;strong&gt;Raphael Khouri,&lt;/strong&gt; and drag performer, writer and filmmaker &lt;strong&gt;Amrou al-Kadhi&lt;/strong&gt; all join translator and editor &lt;strong&gt;Alice Guthrie&lt;/strong&gt; to discuss and read from their luminous and potent work. Our panel of vibrant queer Arab writers show how queer lives, queer selves and queer expression continue to blossom, against the odds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This event is pre-recorded and was conceived and programmed by Alice Guthrie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
