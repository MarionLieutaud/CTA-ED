<p>The hands-on exercise for this week focuses on validating text analysis techniques. We’ll focus on articles and data that we have already encountered in weeks past and investigate how the authors went about validating their findings.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, you will learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manually review</li>
<li>Compare to reference data</li>
<li>Conduct tests for unsupervised approaches</li>
<li>Conduct tests for supervised approaches</li>
</ul>

<p>A first step in any text analysis technique should be to eyeball your data and the results of any analysis you carry out. This might not sound very formalized as an approach—and it isn’t—but it is what every good practitioner will find themselves doing at some stage.</p>
<p>Some refer to this kind of check as a “sanity check.” What would such a check look like in practice?</p>
<p>Well, let’s take an example from the beginning of the course, where we looked at event descriptions from the Edinburgh International Book Festival.</p>
<p>We’ll first read in this data.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb445"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="va">edbfdata</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu"><a href="https://readr.tidyverse.org/reference/read_delim.html">read_csv</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"data/wordfreq/edbookfestall.csv"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<pre><code>## New names:
## Rows: 5938 Columns: 12
## ── Column specification
## ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: "," chr
## (8): festival_id, title, sub_title, artist, description, genre, age_category, ID dbl (4): ...1, year,
## latitude, longitude
## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ Specify the column types or set
## `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
## • `` -&gt; `...1`</code></pre>
<p>As ever, if you’re working on this document from your own computer (“locally”) you can download the Edinburgh Fringe data in the following way:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb447"><pre class="sourceCode r"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb447-1"><a href="exercise-9-validation.html#cb447-1" tabindex="-1"></a>edbfdata <span class="ot">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">read_csv</span>(<span class="st">"https://github.com/cjbarrie/CTA-ED/blob/main/data/wordfreq/edbookfestall.csv"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>We’ll get the data into tidy format as before, tagging individual words for whether or not they appear in our dictionary of woman- and gender-related terms. One addition here is that we’re ascribing each event an individual ID, which will be useful in the next step.</p>

Chaired by Jamie Jauncey.<\/p>","2":"2012","3":"EVENT51"},{"1":"The Ayrshire author has taken time out of her fictional endeavours to pen the latest instalment of her memoir. All Made Up takes the story into her teenage years and focuses on the morals and ambitions of one small town through the stories of three generations of women. Galloway was struggling to make sense of the changes caused by adolescence, and almost everything began to feel different.

They are ordinary men and women who have to deal with harassment, political killings, &lsquo;disappearances&rsquo;, arbitrary detention, torture, exile and murder.

Simon Mawer and Mich&egrave;le Roberts, each previously shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize, discuss their new novels.

Flanked by her Scottish friend and companion, Liz, China&rsquo;s journey is by turns a literary subversion, a rollicking account of a road trip, a hallucinatory tour of the perils of colonisation and a critique of nationalist myth building.<\/p>\\nAlongside her translators <strong>Fiona Mackintosh<\/strong> and <strong>Iona Macintyre<\/strong>, Cabez&oacute;n C&aacute;mara makes a welcome return to the Edinburgh International Book Festival, following her visit in 2019, to discuss the challenges and delights of reimagining a classic work of literature with fellow Argentinian novelist and writer <strong>Mariana Enriquez<\/strong>.<\/p>\\nThis is a pre-recorded event.<\/p>","2":"2020","3":"EVENT5857"},{"1":"As part of the Book Festival&#39;s <a href=\"https://www.edbookfest.co.uk/the-festival/whats-on/introducing-outriders-africa\">Outriders programme<\/a>&nbsp;exploring the shifting landscapes of contemporary Africa, rising star of Scottish poetry Nadine Aisha Jassat embarked on a poignant journey across the south-east of the continent with Zimbabwe-based writer and film-maker Tsitsi Dangarembga, whose 1988 debut Nervous Conditions was included in the BBC&#39;s 2018 list of the 100 books that shaped the world.<\/p>\\nFascinated by the rich tradition of storytelling in their shared Zimbabwean ancestry and the voices erased within it, they set out to retrace the funereal route of David Livingstone, whose body was carried from modern day Zambia to the coast of Tanzania by his two attendants, Susi and Chuma.<\/p>\\nTheir adventure took an unexpected turn when Jassat was forced to return to the UK at short notice during the height of the pandemic, leaving Dangarembga to complete the journey solo.

<p>A second technique for determining the validity of data involves comparing to external data with which we might expect to see a close comparison—if our text-based measure is precisely estimated.</p>
<p>A good example of this comes from the week on scaling techniques. Here, the article by <span class="citation">Kaneko, Asano, and Miwa (<a href="references-2.html#ref-kaneko_estimating_2021">2021</a>)</span> took editorial texts from newspapers to determine whether we could estimate the ideological outlook of these newspapers. In order to determine whether these measures are accurate, however, we need to compare them to some reference data.</p>
<p>For newspapers, this information might come from expert surveys scoring the bias of newspapers or similar.</p>
<p>We can access data from the first study by <span class="citation">Kaneko, Asano, and Miwa (<a href="references-2.html#ref-kaneko_estimating_2021">2021</a>)</span> in the following way.</p>

<p>In the example worksheet for topic modelling, we encountered several tests included in the <code>preText</code> package to validate pre-processing steps for our topic models.</p>
<p>Another article, by <span class="citation">Ying, Montgomery, and Stewart (<a href="references-2.html#ref-ying_topics_2021">2021</a>)</span>, describes several additional tests we might conduct to validate our model output.</p>
<p>These include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Word lists</li>
<li>Fit statistics</li>
<li>Additional (qualitative) coding</li>
<li>Human coders</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Word intrusion (identify the most irrelevant word)</li>
<li>Word set intrusion (identify lowest probability topic word sets for a document)</li>
<li>Label intrusion</li>
<li>Optimal label selection</li>
</ul>
<p>A very good package for implementing some of these procedures is <code>oolong</code> by Chung-Hong Chan.</p>
<p>You can find details of the package <a href="https://www.theoj.org/joss-papers/joss.02461/10.21105.joss.02461.pdf">here</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/oolong/oolong.pdf">here</a>. For intrusion-type tasks, the package allows the user to easily launch interactive windows to complete the tasks and record the data.</p>
<p>We take here an example from scientific abstracts data bundled in the package. We then generate a “Shiny” app—basically an R-based form of interactice UIs.</p>

<p>To launch the the Shiny app generated by the <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/oolong/man/export_oolong.html">export_oolong()</a></code> call, we simply do the following, pointing to the same directory we used to save our exported oolong app.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb463"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span class="fu">shiny</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/reference/shiny/latest/runApp.html">runApp</a></span><span class="op">(</span><span class="st">"data/validation//wsi_test"</span><span class="op">)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And we should see a window that looks something like this.</p>
