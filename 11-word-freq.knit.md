# Exercise 1: Word frequency analysis

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how to summarise, aggregate, and analyze text in R:

* How to tokenize and filter text
* How to clean and preprocess text
* How to visualize results with ggplot
* How to perform automated gender assignment from name data (and think about possible biases these methods may enclose)

## Setup 

To practice these skills, we will use a dataset that I have already collected from the Edinburgh Fringe Festival website. 

You can try this out yourself too: to obtain these data, you must first obtain an API key. Instructions on how to do this are available at the [Edinburgh Fringe API page](https://api.edinburghfestivalcity.com/documentation/fringe_approval):

##  Load data and packages 

Before proceeding, we'll load the remaining packages we will need for this tutorial.
