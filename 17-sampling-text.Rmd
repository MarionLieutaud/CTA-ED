# Exercise 7: Sampling text information

## Introduction

The hands-on exercise for this week focuses on how to collect and/or sample text information. 

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

* Access text information from online corpora
* Query text information using different APIs
* Scrape text information programmatically
* Transcribe text information from audio

## Online corpora

### Replication datasets

There are large numbers of online corpora and replication datasets available to access freely online. We will first access such an example using the `dataverse` package in R, which allows us to download directly from replication data repositories stored at the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/).

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
library(dataverse)
library(dplyr)
```

Let's take an example dataset in which we might be interested: the UK parliamentary speech data from 

We first need to set an en environment variable as so. 

```{r}
Sys.setenv("DATAVERSE_SERVER" = "dataverse.harvard.edu")
```

We can then search out the files that we want by specifying the DOI of the publication data in question. We can find this as a series of numbers and letters that come after "https://doi.org/" as shown below. 

![](data/sampling/doi.png){width=100%}

```{r}
dataset <- get_dataset("10.7910/DVN/QDTLYV")
dataset$files[c("filename", "contentType")]
```

We choose to get the UK data from these files, which is listed under "UK_data.csv." We can then download this directly in the following way (this will take some time as the file size is >1GB).

```{r, eval = F}
data <- get_dataframe_by_name(
  "uk_data.csv",
  "10.7910/DVN/QDTLYV",
  .f = function(x) read.delim(x, sep = ","))

```

Of course, we could also download these data manually, by clicking the buttons at the relevant [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)---but it is sometimes useful to build in every step of your data collection to your code documentation, making the analysis entirely programatically reproducible from start to finish.

Note as well that we don't have to search out specific datasets that we already know about. We can also use the `dataverse` package to search datasets or dataverses. We can do this very simply in the following way. 

```{r}
search_results <- dataverse_search("corpus politics text", type = "dataset", per_page = 10)

search_results[,1:3]
```

### Curated corpora

There are, of course, many other sources you might go to for text information. I list some of these that might be of interest below:

- Large English-language corpora: [https://www.corpusdata.org/](https://www.corpusdata.org/)
- Wikipedia data dumps: [https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dumps](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Data_dumps)
  - English version of dumps [here](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/enwiki/)
- Scottish Corpus of Texts & Speech: [https://www.scottishcorpus.ac.uk/](https://www.scottishcorpus.ac.uk/)
- Corpus of Scottish modern writing: [https://www.scottishcorpus.ac.uk/cmsw/](https://www.scottishcorpus.ac.uk/cmsw/)
- The Manifesto Corpus: [https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/information/documents/corpus](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/information/documents/corpus)
- Reddit Pushshift data: [https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/](https://files.pushshift.io/reddit/)
- Mediacloud: [https://mediacloud.org/](https://mediacloud.org/)
  - R package: [https://github.com/joon-e/mediacloud](https://github.com/joon-e/mediacloud)

**Feel free to recommend any further sources and I will add them to this list, which is intended as a growing index of relevant text corpora for social science research!**

## Using APIs

To practice these skills, you might want to create a new account for your academic research. But you needn't create a new account to follow the steps below. You can simply use your own account---if you have one---as using the developer tools will not change anything about your public Twitter account. 

![](data/sampling/twitterdev.png){width=100%}

Before proceeding, we'll load the remaining packages we will need for this tutorial.

```{r, message=F}
library(tidyverse) # loads dplyr, ggplot2, and others
library(rtweet) # to query the Twitter API in R
```

Once you've create your new account, or have logged into your existing one, go to the Twitter developer portal log in page [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en).

Click on Apply in the navigation bar on the top right of the page. You'll be asked "what best describes you?" For the purposes of this tutorial, select academic, and then select student. Fill in all the relevant information and submit your application. Your application will then be reviewed by Twitter before access is granted. This might take hours or days.

Once you have authorization, a new tab will appear in the navigation bar at the top of the develop portal, as below:

![](data/sampling/twitterdev2.png){width=100%}

Navigate to the developer portal and you will there be able to create a new "app" to query the API. You see in my account that I have several apps for different purposes.

![](data/sampling/twitterdev3.png){width=100%}
We can create a new app on this page too. When we click "Create App" we will first be asked to name the app. Most importantly, we will then be given an "API key"; an "API secret key"; and a "Bearer token" as below.

![](data/sampling/twitterdev4.png){width=30%}

You **MUST** make a record of these. Once you have done so, you can then use these to access the API. Once you have recorded these, navigate to the App setting tabs for the App you've created now listed in the Overview tab on the left hand side navigation window.

![](data/sampling/twitterdev5.png){width=50%}

Navigate to "Keys and tokens" on this page, and click generate in the Access token & secret box as below:

![](data/sampling/twitterdev6.png){width=50%}

Record these as well. Once you have all of these keys and tokens recorded somewhere safe, you are ready to collect data!

This is pretty simple using the <tt>rtweet</tt> package. Below, we'll collect the last 50 tweets of the founder of Twitter: Jack Dorsey. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
api_key <-" XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
api_key_secret <- "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
access_token <- "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
access_token_secret <- "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"

token <- create_token(
  app = "NAME YOUR APP",
  consumer_key = api_key,
  consumer_secret = api_key_secret,
  access_token = access_token,
  access_secret = access_token_secret
)

user <- "@jack"
jacktweets <- get_timeline(user, n = 50)

head(jacktweets)

```

Once you have enter your keys, tokens, and key/token secrets, store them with the `create_token()` function. Here, we are collecting the last 50 tweets for Jack Dorsey, though you can change this by specifying a higher n---be aware, though, that the maximum you are able to collect with the basic API access is 3200 tweets. 

```{r, echo=F, warning=-F, message=F}

library(kableExtra)

jacktweets <- readRDS("data/sampling/jacktweets.rds")

jacktweets <- jacktweets %>%
  select(created_at, screen_name, text)

kbl(jacktweets[1:10,]) %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```

Now you can play around with the different API calls possible with the <tt>rtweet</tt> package. See the full documentation [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rtweet/rtweet.pdf) and [here](https://github.com/ropensci/rtweet).

And for those interested, you can my package to collect tweets from the Academic Research Product Track API [here](https://github.com/cjbarrie/academictwitteR).

Getting access to the Academic Research Product Track is a bit more complicated but for more information on how to apply see [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research/products-for-researchers).

In order to use the Twitter Academic Research Product Track you will first need to obtain an authorization token. You will find details about the process of obtaining authorization [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research/application-info). 

**In order to gain authorization you first need a Twitter account.**

First, Twitter will ask for details about your academic profile. Per the documentation linked above, they will ask for the following:

> Your full name as it is appears on your institution’s documentation
> 
>   Links to webpages that help establish your identity; provide one or more of the following:
> 
>   - A link to your profile in your institution’s faculty or student directory
>   - A link to your Google Scholar profile
>   - A link to your research group, lab or departmental website where you are listed
> 
>   Information about your academic institution: its name, country, state, and city
> 
>   Your department, school, or lab name
> 
>   Your academic field of study or discipline at this institution
> 
>   Your current role as an academic (whether you are a graduate student, doctoral candidate,       post-doc, professor, research scientist, or other faculty member)

Twitter will then ask for details of the proposed research project. Here, questions include:

> 1. What is the name of your research project?
>
> 2. Does this project receive funding from outside your academic institution? If yes, please list all your sources of funding.
>
> 3. In English, describe your research project. Minimum 200 characters.
>
> 4. In English, describe how Twitter data via the Twitter API will be used in your research project. Minimum 200 characters.
>
> 5. In English, describe your methodology for analyzing Twitter data, Tweets, and/or Twitter users. Minimum 200 characters.
>
> 6. Will your research present Twitter data individually or in aggregate?
>
> 7. In English, describe how you will share the outcomes of your research (include tools, data, and/or other resources you hope to build and share). Minimum 200 characters.
>
> 8. Will your analysis make Twitter content or derived information available to a government entity?

Once you have gained authorization for your project you will be able to see the new project on your Twitter developer portal.

The Academic Research Product Track permits the user to access larger volumes of data, over a far longer time range, than was previously possible. From the Twitter [documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research/application-info):

> "The Academic Research product track includes full-archive search, as well as increased access and other v2 endpoints and functionality designed to get more precise and complete data for analyzing the public conversation, at no cost for qualifying researchers. Since the Academic Research track includes specialized, greater levels of access, it is reserved solely for non-commercial use".

The new "v2 endpoints" refer to the v2 API, introduced around the same time as the new Academic Research Product Track. Full details of the v2 endpoints are available [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access).

In summary the Academic Research product track allows the authorized user:

1. Access to the full archive of (as-yet-undeleted) tweets published on Twitter
2. A higher monthly tweet cap (10m--or 20x what was previously possible with the standard v1.1 API)
3. Ability to access these data with more precise filters permitted by the v2 API

If you do get authorization for using the Twitter Academic API, you can then follow the next steps to begin collecting data. Instead of four different keys or secrets, we will have one "bearer token" that we use, associated with one of the apps that we created as above. This is all we then need to begin collecting data. 

First we need to load the package into memory as follows.

```{r}
library(academictwitteR)
```

The first task is set authorization credentials with the `set_bearer()` function, which allows the user to store their bearer token in the .Renviron file.

To do so, use:

```{r, eval=F}
set_bearer()
```

and enter authorization credentials as below:

![](data/sampling/TWITTER_BEARER.gif)

This will mean that the bearer token is automatically called during API calls. It also avoids the inadvisable practice of hard-coding authorization credentials into scripts. 

The workhorse function is `get_all_tweets()`, which is able to collect tweets matching a specific search query or all tweets by a specific set of users.

```{r, eval=F}

tweets <-
  get_all_tweets(
    query = "#BlackLivesMatter",
    start_tweets = "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    end_tweets = "2020-01-05T00:00:00Z",
    file = "blmtweets",
    data_path = "data/",
    n = 1000000,
  )
  
```

Here, we are collecting tweets containing a hashtag related to the Black Lives Matter movement over the period January 1, 2020 to January 5, 2020. 

We have also set an upper limit of one million tweets. When collecting large amounts of Twitter data we recommend including a `data_path` and setting `bind_tweets = FALSE` such that data is stored as JSON files and can be bound at a later stage upon completion of the API query.

```{r, eval=F}

tweets <-
  get_all_tweets(
    users = c("jack", "cbarrie"),
    start_tweets = "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    end_tweets = "2020-01-05T00:00:00Z",
    file = "blmtweets",
    n = 1000
  )
  
```

Whereas here we are not specifying a search query and instead are requesting all tweets by users "jack" and "cbarrie" over the period January 1, 2020 to January 5, 2020. Here, we set an upper limit of 1000 tweets.

The search query and user query arguments can be combined in a single API call as so:

```{r, eval=F}

get_all_tweets(
  query = "twitter",
  users = c("cbarrie", "jack"),
  start_tweets = "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  end_tweets = "2020-05-01T00:00:00Z",
  n = 1000
)

```

Where here we would be collecting tweets by users "jack" and "cbarrrie" over the period January 1, 2020 to January 5, 2020 containing the word "twitter."

```{r, eval=F}

get_all_tweets(
  query = c("twitter", "social"),
  users = c("cbarrie", "jack"),
  start_tweets = "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  end_tweets = "2020-05-01T00:00:00Z",
  n = 1000
)

```

While here we are collecting tweets by users "jack" and "cbarrrie" over the period January 1, 2020 to January 5, 2020 containing the words "twitter" or "social."

Note that the "AND" operator is implicit when specifying more than one character string in the query. See [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-query) for information on building queries for search tweets. Thus, when searching for all elements of a character string, a call may look like:

```{r, eval=F}

get_all_tweets(
  query = c("twitter social"),
  users = c("cbarrie", "jack"),
  start_tweets = "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  end_tweets = "2020-05-01T00:00:00Z",
  n = 1000
)

```

, which will capture tweets containing *both* the words "twitter" and "social." The same logics apply for hashtag queries.

Whereas if we specify our query as separate elements of a character vector like this:

```{r, eval=F}

get_all_tweets(
  query = c("twitter", "social"),
  users = c("cbarrie", "jack"),
  start_tweets = "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
  end_tweets = "2020-05-01T00:00:00Z",
  n = 1000
)

```
, this will be capturing tweets by users "cbarrie" or "jack" containing the words "twitter" *or* social. 

Finally, we may wish to query an exact phrase. To do so, we can either input the phrase in escape quotes, e.g., `query ="\"Black Lives Matter\""` or we can use the optional parameter `exact_phrase = T` to search for tweets containing the exact phrase string:

```{r, eval=F}

tweets <-
  get_all_tweets(
    query = "#BlackLivesMatter",
    start_tweets = "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    end_tweets = "2020-01-05T00:00:00Z",
    file = "blmtweets",
    data_path = "data/",
    n = 1000000,
  )
  
```

Here, we are collecting tweets containing a hashtag related to the Black Lives Matter movement over the period January 1, 2020 to January 5, 2020.

And the Twitter API is, of course, not the only API out there!

### Other APIs (R packages)

- [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/manifestoR/index.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/manifestoR/index.html)
- [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vkR/vkR.pdf](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vkR/vkR.pdf)

## Scraping

To practice this skill, we will use a series of webpages on the Internet Archive that host material collected at the Arab Spring protests in Egypt in 2011. The original website can be seen [here](https://www.tahrirdocuments.org/) and below.

![](data/sampling/tahrir_page.png){width=100%}

Before proceeding, we'll load the remaining packages we will need for this tutorial.

```{r, message=F}
library(tidyverse) # loads dplyr, ggplot2, and others
library(ggthemes) # includes a set of themes to make your visualizations look nice!
library(readr) # more informative and easy way to import data
library(stringr) # to handle text elements
library(rvest) #for scraping
```

We can download the final dataset we will produce with:

```{r}
pamphdata <- read_csv("data/sampling/pamphlets_formatted_gsheets.csv")
```

You can also view the formatted output of this scraping exercise, alongside images of the documents in question, in Google Sheets [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rg2VTV6uuknpu6u-L5n7kvQ2cQ6e6Js7IHp7CaSKe90/edit?usp=sharing).

If you're working on this document from your own computer ("locally") you can download the Tahrir documents data in the following way:

```{r, eval = F}
pamphdata <- read_csv("https://github.com/cjbarrie/CTA-ED/blob/main/data/sampling/pamphlets_formatted_gsheets.csv")

```

Let's have a look at what we will end up producing:


```{r}
head(pamphdata)
```

We are going to return to the Internet Archived webpages to see how we can produce this final formatted dataset. The archived Tahrir Documents webpages can be accessed [here](https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/).

We first want to expect how the contents of each webpage is stored.

When we scroll to the very bottom of the page, we see listed a number of hyperlinks to documents stored by month:

![](data/sampling/tahrir_archives.png)

We will click through the documents stored for March and then click on the top listed pamphlet entitled "The Season of Anger Sets in Among the Arab Peoples." You can access this [here](https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130161341/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/voice-of-the-revolution-3-page-2/).

We will store this url to inspect the HTML it contains as follows:

```{r}
url <- "https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130161341/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/voice-of-the-revolution-3-page-2/"

html <- read_html(url)

html
```

Well, this isn't particularly useful. Let's now see how we can extract the text contained inside.

```{r}
pagetext <- html %>%
  html_text()

pagetext
```

Well this looks pretty terrifying now...

We need a way of quickly identifying where the relevant text is so that we can specify this when we are scraping. The most widely-used tool to achieve this is the "Selector Gadget" Chrome Extension. You can add this to your browser for free [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb?hl=en). 

The tool works by allowing the user to point and click on elements of a webpage (or "CSS selectors"). Unlike alternatives, such as "Inspect Element" browser tools, we are easily able to see how the webpage item is contained within CSS selectors (rather than HTML tags alone), which is easier to parse. 

We can do this with our Tahrir documents as below:

![](data/sampling/gifcap4.gif){width=100%}

So now we know that the main text of the translated document is contained between "p" HTML tags. To identify the text between these HTML tags we can run:

```{r}
pagetext <- html %>%
  html_elements("p") %>%
  html_text(trim=TRUE)

pagetext
  
```

, which looks quite a lot more manageable...! 

What is happening here? Essentially, the `html_elements()` function is scanning the page and collecting all HTML elements contained between `<p>` tags, which we collect using the "p" CSS selector. We are then just grabbing the text contained in this part of the page with the `html_text()` function. 

So this gives us one way of capturing the text, but what about if we wanted to get other elements of the document, for example the date or the tags attributed to each document? Well we can do the same thing here too. Let's take the example of getting the date:

![](data/sampling/gifcap5.gif){width=100%}

We see here that the date is identified by the ".calendar" CSS selector and so we enter this into the same `html_elements()` function as before:

```{r}
pagedate <- html %>% 
  html_elements(".calendar") %>%
  html_text(trim=TRUE)

pagedate
  
```

Of course, this is all well and good, but we also need a way of doing this at scale---we can't just keep repeating the same process for every page we find as this wouldn't be much quicker than just copy pasting. So how can we do this? Well we need first to understand the URL structure of the website in question.

When we scroll down the page we see listed a number of documents. Each of these directs to an individual pamphlet distributed at protests during the 2011 Egyptian Revolution. 

Click on one of these and see how the URL changes.

We see that if our starting URL was:

```{r, echo=F}
starturl <- "https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130135111/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/"
```

```{r, echo=F, comment=NA}
cat(starturl)
```

Then if we click on March 2011, the first month for which we have documents, we see that the url becomes:

```{r, echo=F}
marchurl <- "https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/"
 
augusturl <- "https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130142155/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/08/"

jan2012url <- "https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130142014/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2012/01/"

```

```{r, echo=F, comment=NA}
cat(marchurl)
```

, for August 2011 it becomes:

```{r, echo=F, comment=NA}
cat(augusturl)
```

, and for January 2012 it becomes:

```{r, echo=F, comment=NA}
cat(jan2012url)
```

We notice that for each month, the URL changes with the addition of month and year between back slashes at the end or the URL. In the next section, we will go through how to efficiently create a set of URLs to loop through and retrieve the information contained in each individual webpage.

We are going to want to retrieve the text of documents archived for each month. As such, our first task is to store each of these webpages as a series of strings. We could do this manually by, for example, pasting year and month strings to the end of each URL for each month from March, 2011 to January, 2012:

```{r}
url <- "https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/"

url1 <- paste0(url,"2011/03/")
url2 <- paste0(url,"2011/04/")
url3 <- paste0(url,"2011/04/")

#etc...

urls <- c(url1, url2, url3)
    
```

But this wouldn't be particularly efficient...

Instead, we can wrap all of this in a loop. 

```{r}
urls <- character(0)
for (i in 3:13) {
  url <- "https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/"
  newurl <- ifelse(i <10, paste0(url,"2011/0",i,"/"), 
                   ifelse(i>=10 & i<=12 , paste0(url,"2011/",i,"/"), 
                          paste0(url,"2012/01/")))
  urls <- c(urls, newurl)
}
```

What's going on here? Well, we are first specifying the starting URL as above. We are then iterating through the numbers 3 to 13. And we are telling R to take the new URL and then, depending on the number in the loop we are on, to take the base starting url--- `r url` --- and to paste on the end of it the string "2011/0", then the number of the loop we are on, and then "/". So, for the first "i" in the loop---the number 3---then we are effectively calling the equivalent of:

```{r}

i <- 3

url <- "https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/"

newurl <- paste0(url,"2011/0",i,"/")
```

Which gives:

```{r, echo=F}
newurl
```

In the above, the `ifelse()` commands are simply telling R: if i (the number of the loop we are on) is less than 10 then `paste0(url,"2011/0",i,"/")`; i.e., if i is less than 10 then paste "2011/0", then "i" and then "/". So for the number 3 this becomes:

`"https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/"` 

, and for the number 4 this becomes 

`"https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/04/"`

If, however, `i>=10 & i<=12` (i is greater than or equal to 10 and less than or equal to 12) then we are calling `paste0(url,"2011/",i,"/")` because here we do not need the first "0" in the months. 

Finally, if (else) i is greater than 12 then we are calling `paste0(url,"2012/01/")`. For this last call, notice, we do not have to specify whether i is greater than or equal to 12 because we are wrapping everything in `ifelse()` commands. With `ifelse()` calls like this, we are telling R if x "meets condition" then do y, otherwise do z. When we are wrapping multiple `ifelse()` calls within each other, we are effectively telling R if x "meets condition" then do y, or if x "meets other condition" then do z, otherwise do a. So here, the "otherwise do a" part of the `ifelse()` calls is saying: if i is not less than 10, and is not between 10 and 12, then paste "2012/01/" to the end of the URL.

Got it? I didn't even get it on first reading... and I wrote it. The best way to understand what is going on is to run this code yourself and look at what each part is doing.

So now we have our list of URLs for each month. What next?

Well if we go onto the page of a particular month, let's say March, we will see that the page has multiple paginated tabs at the bottom. Let's see what happens to the URL when we click on one of these:

```{r, echo=F}
marchurl <- "https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130143023/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/"
marchurlp2 <- "https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130163651/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/page/2/"
marchurlp3 <- "https://wayback.archive-it.org/2358/20120130163651/http://www.tahrirdocuments.org/2011/03/page/3/"
```

We see that if our starting point URL for March, as above, was:

```{r, echo=F, comment=NA}
cat(marchurl)
```

When we click through to page 2 it becomes:

```{r, echo=F, comment=NA}
cat(marchurlp2)
```

And for page 3 it becomes:

```{r, echo=F, comment=NA}
cat(marchurlp3)
```

We can see pretty clearly that as we navigate through each page, there appears appended to the URL the string "page/2/" and "page/3/". So this shouldn't be too tricky to add to our list of URLs. But we want to avoid having to manually click through the archive for each month to figure out how many pagination tabs are at the bottom of each page. 

Fortunately, we don't have to. Using the "Selector Gadget" tool again we can automate this process by grabbing the highest number that appears in the pagination bar for each month's pages. The code below achieves this:

```{r, eval=F}

urlpages_all <- character(0) #create empty character string to deposit our final set of urls
urlpages <- character(0) #create empty character string to deposit our urls for each page of each month
for (i in seq_along(urls)) { #for loop for each url stored above
  url <- urls[i] #take the first url from the vector of urls created above
  html <- read_html(url) #read the html
  pages <- html %>%
    html_elements(".page") %>% #grab the page element
    html_text() #convert to text
  pageints <- as.integer(pages) #convert to set of integers
  npages <- max(pageints, na.rm = T) #get number of highest integer
  
  for (j in 1:npages) { #for loop for each of 1:highest page integer for that month's url
  newurl <- paste0(url,"page/",j,"/") #create new url by pasting "page/" and then the number of that page, and then "/", matching the url structure identified above
  urlpages <- c(urlpages, newurl) #bind with previously created page urls for each month
  }
  urlpages_all <- c(urlpages_all, urlpages) #bind the monthly page by page urls together
  urlpages <- character(0) #empty urlpages for next iteration of the first for loop
  urlpages_all <- gsub("page/1/", "", urlpages_all) #get rid of page/1/ as not needed
}
```

```{r, echo=F}
urlpages_all <- readRDS("data/sampling/urlpages_all.RDS")
```

What's going on here? Well, in the first two lines, we are simply creating an empty character string that we're going to populate in the subsequent loop. Remember that we have a set of eleven starting URLs for each of months archived on this webpage. 

So in the code beginning `for (i in seq_along(files)` we saying, similar to above, for the beginning url to the end url, do the following in a loop: first, read in the url with `url <- urls[i]` then read the html it contains with   `html <- read_html(url)`.

After this line, we are getting the pages as a character vector of page numbers by calling the `html_elements()` function on the ".page" tag. this gives a series of pages stored as e.g. "1" "2" "3". 

In order to be able to see how many there are, we need to extract the highest number that appears in this string. To do this, we first need to reformat it as an "integer" object rather than a "character" object so that R can recognize that these are numbers. So we call `pageints <- as.integer(pages)`. Then we get the maximum by simply calling: `npages <- max(pageints, na.rm = T)`. 

In the next part of the loop, we are taking the new information we have stored as "npages," i.e., the number of pagination tabs for each month, and telling R: for each of these pages, define a new url by adding "page/" then the number of the pagination tab "j", and then "/". After we've bound all of these together, we get a list of URLs that look like this:

```{r}
head(urlpages_all)
```

So what next?

The next step is to get the URLs for each of the documents contained in the archive for each month. How do we do this? Well, we can once again use the "Selector Gadget" tool to work this out. For the main landing pages of each month, we see listed, as below, each document in a list. For each of these documents, we see that the title, which links to the revolutionary leaflet in question, has two CSS selectors: "h2" and ".post".

![](data/sampling/gifcap6.gif){width=100%}

We can again pass these tags through `html_elements()` to grab what's contained inside. We can then grab what's contained inside these by extracting the "children" of these classes. In essence, this just means a lower level tag: tags can have tags within tags and these flow downwards like a family tree (hence the name, I suppose). 

So one of the "children" of this HTML tag is the link contained inside, which we can get with calling `html_children()` followed by specifying that we want the specific attribute of the web link it encloses with `html_attr("href")`. The subsequent lines then just remove extraneous information. 

The complete loop, then, to retrieve the URL of the page for every leaflet contained on this website is:


```{r, eval =F}
#GET URLS FOR EACH PAMPHLET

pamlinks_all <- character(0)
for (i in seq_along(urlpages_all)) {
  url <- urlpages_all[i]
  html <- read_html(url)
  links <- html_elements(html, ".post , h2") %>%
    html_children() %>%
    html_attr("href") %>%
    na.omit() %>%
    `attributes<-`(NULL)
  pamlinks_all <- c(pamlinks_all, links)
}

```

```{r, echo=F}
pamlinks_all <- readRDS("data/sampling/pamlinks_all.RDS")
```

Which gives us:

```{r}
head(pamlinks_all)

length(pamlinks_all)
```

We see now that we have collected all 523 separate URLs for every revolutionary leaflet contained on these pages. Now we're in a great position to be able to crawl each page and collect the information we need. This final loop is all we need to go through each URL we're interested in and collect relevant information on document text, title, date, tags, and the URL to the image of the revolutionary literature itself.

See if you can work out yourselves how each part of this is fitting together. NOTE: if you want to run the final loop on your own machines it will take several hours to complete. 

```{r, eval=F}

df_empty <- data.frame()
for (i in seq_along(pamlinks_all)) {
  url <- pamlinks_all[i]
  html <- read_html(url)
  cat("Collecting url number ",i,": ", url, "\n")
  
  error <- tryCatch(html <- read_html(url),
                    error=function(e) e)
  if (inherits(error, 'error')) {
    df <- data.frame(title = NA,
                     date = NA,
                     text = NA,
                     imageurl = NA,
                     tags = NA)
    next
  }
  
  df <- data.frame(matrix(ncol=0, nrow=length(1)))
  #get titles
  titles <- html_elements(html, ".title") %>%
    html_text(trim=TRUE)
  
  title <- titles[1]
  df$title <- title
  
  #get date
  date <- html_elements(html, ".calendar") %>%
    html_text(trim=TRUE)
  df$date <- date
  
  #get text
  textsep <-  html_elements(html, "p") %>%
    html_text(trim=TRUE)
  text <- paste(textsep, collapse = ",")
  df$text <- text
  
  #get tags
  pamtags <- html_elements(html, ".category") %>%
    html_text(trim=TRUE)
  df$tags <- pamtags
  
  #get link to original pamphlet image
  elements_other <-  html_elements(html, "a") %>%
    html_children()
  url_element <- as.character(elements_other[2])
  imgurl <- str_extract(url_element, "src=\\S+")
  imgurl <- substr(imgurl, 6, (nchar(imgurl)-1))
  
  df$imageurl <- imgurl
  
  df_empty <- rbind(df_empty, df)
}


```

And now... we're pretty much there...back where we started! 

## Speech to text

There are some R packages that allow the user to connect to the Google Speech-to-Text engine (billing information required to access). You can find such a package [here](https://github.com/ropensci/googleLanguageR) but it doesn't seem to be readily maintained. There is a far wider range of options if you are open to using Python: see, e.g.: [here](https://realpython.com/python-speech-recognition/). 

Here, we're instead going to do the next best thing: capture text that has already been converted from speech. Here, we're going to be collecting the automated English captioning from YouTube videos. For this, we will use the R package `youtubecaption`. Because this package connects to an already existing Python package under the hood, you'll need to have a Conda environment installed. You can download Anaconda Individual Edition [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).

And to grab the text from a video is as simple as below.

```{r, eval = F}
library(youtubecaption)

url <- "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpbtcsGE0OA"
caption <- get_caption(url)
caption

```

And if you wanted to the same thing in Python you would do the following. 

```{python, eval = F}
!pip install youtube_transcript_api

from youtube_transcript_api import YouTubeTranscriptApi

YouTubeTranscriptApi.get_transcript("cpbtcsGE0OA")
```
